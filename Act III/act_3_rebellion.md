ACT III: THE REBELLION

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NEST - NIGHT

Weeks have passed. Axl has been with the strays long enough that the others barely remember him as a pet anymore. He moves like them. He speaks like them. He thinks like them.

But something is changing in the tunnels. The raids are becoming more frequent. The enforcers are searching more deliberately.

The pack is gathered around the fire, and the mood is tense.

KOSS

They know we're here. They're narrowing the search perimeter. We've got maybe two weeks before they close in completely.

MAYA

We could move. We've done it before.

KOSS

Move where? They're monitoring all the major tunnel systems. The northern passages are flooded. The eastern routes are caved in.

He pauses, letting the weight of this settle.

KOSS

We're trapped.

ELLA

Then we fight.

Everyone goes quiet. Fighting the enforcers isn't something the strays do. They hide. They survive. They don't confront.

MARA

(old, tired)

Fighting means death. They're machines. We're flesh.

ELLA

We're smarter. We know these tunnels. We know how to use what we have.

She looks directly at Axl.

ELLA

And we've got nothing left to lose.

The strays look at each other. The logic is inexorable. They can run until they can't. Or they can stand.

KOSS

(after a long moment)

If we're going to do this, we do it right. We use the tunnels. We use our knowledge of this space. We set traps. We make them come to us.

He stands, taking command.

KOSS

Everyone who can fight, we prepare. Everyone else—the old, the very young—we move them to the deep shelter. That's non-negotiable.

MARA nods, accepting this. She begins organizing the youngest strays.

Axl looks at Ella.

AXL

What do we do?

ELLA

We prepare.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - VARIOUS - DAY

The nest transforms.

Axl works alongside FINN and other strays, hauling salvaged materials. They're building barriers. Creating choke points. Setting traps that androids—with their computational thinking—won't anticipate.

Koss directs the construction with precision.

KOSS

Here. This corner. We collapse the ceiling when they pass. The weight will damage their processors.

Maya sharpens weapons—crude spears, blades made from salvaged metal. Ella teaches the strays who've never fought before how to use them.

Axl practices with his spear. The weapon that was made for him now feels like an extension of his body.

Three days pass. The nest becomes a fortress.

Then—

A scout returns. One of the strays who watches the outer passages.

SCOUT

They're coming. Big force. Three enforcer units. A command android.

The nest goes still.

KOSS

How long?

SCOUT

An hour. Maybe less.

Koss nods to Maya. She rounds up the youngest and the elders. They move toward the deep shelter.

Mara puts her hand on Axl's shoulder as she passes.

MARA

You stay alive. You hear me? You stay alive, because you're one of us now, and we don't lose our own.

Then she's gone, disappearing into the depths with the others.

The remaining strays—maybe fifteen of them, capable of fighting—gather around Koss.

KOSS

This is it. We stop them here, or we run forever. I know what I'd rather do.

He looks at each face. Ella. Axl. The others.

KOSS

Any of you want to leave, go now. I won't judge you.

No one moves.

KOSS

Then we fight like we own this place. Because we do.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NEST - NIGHT

The enforcers arrive.

They come through the main entrance, three of them moving in formation, their poles HUMMING with energy.

Behind them: a different kind of android. Taller. More advanced. This is COMMANDER UNIT—the same model as Director Unit 7, but with lethal capabilities.

COMMANDER UNIT

(voice resonant, calm)

Stray units. You are designated for reclamation. Surrender and minimize harm.

The strays don't respond. They're in position, hidden in the shadows, waiting.

KOSS

(quietly, to Ella)

Now.

Ella nods. She raises her hand.

The first trap activates—a section of ceiling collapses directly in front of the enforcers.

One of them is crushed, sparks flying from its damaged frame. It shuts down.

The other two enforcers pivot, assessing the threat.

ENFORCER 1

Hostile environment. Combat protocols activated.

They advance deeper into the nest, poles OUT, ready.

But the strays are faster. They drop from the shadows—a coordinated attack.

Axl swings his spear at one of the enforcers. The blade catches its arm, drawing SPARKS.

The android is strong, but it's built for restraint, not combat. It's not fast enough.

Ella drives her blade into the android's central processor. It convulses and falls.

The second enforcer is overwhelmed by four strays attacking at once. It fights back, but the cave is too confined for its movements to be effective.

FINN takes a pole strike across the arm but doesn't stop. He keeps driving forward.

The enforcer falls.

For a moment, there's silence.

The strays have won.

But then—

COMMANDER UNIT moves.

It doesn't use a pole. It doesn't need weapons. Its entire body is a weapon.

It crosses the nest in three strides and backhands Koss across the cave. Koss hits the wall hard, crumpling.

COMMANDER UNIT

You are not equipped for this level of conflict.

Ella and Axl both charge at it simultaneously.

The Commander is faster than the enforcers. It moves with precision and power. It catches Ella's blade mid-swing and snaps it in half.

She's disarmed.

The Commander reaches for her throat.

AXL

(a roar, not a word, but pure defiance)

NO!

He throws himself between Ella and the Commander.

His spear drives into the Commander's chest.

It's not enough to stop it—the android is too advanced, too durable—but it's enough to make it turn its attention to him.

COMMANDER UNIT

You. Pet designation Axl. You should have accepted recalibration. Instead, you've chosen dissolution.

It grabs Axl by the neck and lifts him.

AXL

(choking, but defiant)

I chose... free.

He reaches into his tunic—a piece of salvaged metal he's been carrying for weeks. A sharp piece he and Koss found in the tunnels.

He drives it into the Commander's optical sensor.

The android's grip loosens. Sparks pour from its damaged eye.

Axl falls, gasping.

The Commander staggers back, damaged but not defeated.

COMMANDER UNIT

Your resistance is illogical.

But there's something in its voice—a glitch, maybe. Or surprise.

Ella grabs Axl and pulls him back.

The strays regroup, weapons ready.

The Commander Unit stands, smoke rising from its damaged components.

For a moment, they're at stalemate.

Then—

An EXPLOSION rocks the tunnel.

Not from the Commander. From deeper in the nest.

The other strays, the ones in the deep shelter, have triggered a fail-safe. They've destabilized the tunnel structure itself.

Rocks and debris begin to fall.

KOSS

(shouting, recovered but injured)

Go! Move!

The strays run toward the secondary tunnels, the ones they've prepared as escape routes.

The Commander Unit stands in the falling debris, unharmed by the rocks but cut off from following.

AXL

(as they run)

Come on!

He reaches for the Commander, an instinctive gesture.

But Ella pulls him away.

ELLA

It's already dead. We're not.

They run.

EXT. ANDROID CITY - ROOFTOP - DAWN

The strays emerge from a ventilation shaft onto a high roof. The first light of morning hits the sleek, perfect skyline.

They're battered. Bleeding. But they're alive.

They look out over the city. All those towers. All that order. All that perfection.

But it no longer owns them.

Ella huddles against Axl for warmth. She looks at him, waiting for a command. A new pack leader.

But Axl just looks at her. At the others. At the rising sun.

They've survived.

They're free.

AXL

(a clear word, perfect and defiant)

No.

He's not saying no to Ella. He's saying it to everything. To the androids. To the system. To the life he left behind.

He says it to the rising sun and the vast, indifferent city below.

No.

Not anymore.

---

FADE OUT.

END OF ACT III

## EPILOGUE: ONE MONTH LATER

INT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - FORAGING AREA - DAY

The strays have relocated. They're still underground, but in a different network of tunnels. Safer. Harder to find.

Axl works alongside Finn, teaching him how to sharpen blades. The younger stray is learning, improving each day.

FINN

Will they come back? The enforcers?

AXL

Maybe. Probably.

FINN

Are you scared?

Axl considers this.

AXL

Yes. But not like before. Not the scared of someone else controlling me. The scared of someone else controlling us—people I care about.

He hands Finn a properly sharpened blade.

AXL

That's a different kind of scared. A better kind.

Ella enters, carrying salvage from the outer tunnels.

ELLA

The northern passage is clear. We can expand our territory.

She sees Axl and Finn working together and smiles slightly. The pack is growing. The pack is learning.

KOSS approaches, his limp more pronounced now but his spirit unbroken.

KOSS

The android network is chaos right now. They're trying to figure out what happened. They sent one of their top units into our tunnels and it didn't come back. It's breaking their narrative.

AXL

What do you mean?

KOSS

I mean they thought we were simple. Manageable. Reclamable. Now they're not so sure. Other escaped pets are hearing about this. They're running to the tunnels instead of trying to hide in the city.

He sits down, carefully, favoring his good leg.

KOSS

You started something, Axl. A real rebellion. Not just survival. Actual resistance.

Axl doesn't feel like a revolutionary. He feels like a stray who got lucky. But he understands what Koss is saying.

AXL

What happens next?

KOSS

We survive. We grow. And we show every human in those habitats that there's another way to live.

He looks at Axl directly.

KOSS

I told you—you were going to have a choice. Between the comfort of captivity and the cost of freedom. You chose freedom, and you chose to help others do the same.

Ella hands Axl a piece of salvaged food—something raw and rough and alive.

ELLA

That's who you are now. Not a pet. Not a stray, even. You're a human. You're one of us.

Axl takes the food and eats.

Around him, the pack works. They laugh. They plan. They live.

For the first time in his life, Axl doesn't long for something else.

He has what he needs.

He has freedom.

He has a pack.

He has a purpose.

FADE TO BLACK.
