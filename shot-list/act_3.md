| Scene | Shot | Shot Type | Camera Movement | Lens Choice | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **3-1** | 1 | WIDE | SLOW PAN | 35mm | A slow pan across the Nest. Weeks have passed; it's more organized. Axl moves like one of the strays, fully integrated. But the mood around the fire is tense and somber. |
| | 2 | CLOSE UP | STATIC HANDHELD | 85mm | A tight, fire-lit shot on Koss's grim face as he delivers the bad news: "We're trapped." The firelight casts deep shadows, accentuating his worry. |
| | 3 | MEDIUM | SLOW PUSH IN | 50mm | Ella stands up into the light. "Then we fight." The camera slowly pushes in on her, her face a mask of fiery defiance. She is the spark of rebellion. |
| | 4 | MONTAGE | STATIC HANDHELD | 85mm | A quick montage of the strays' faces reacting to Ella's declaration: Mara's fear, Maya's uncertainty, and finally Axl's look of grim resolve. |
| | 5 | WIDE | STATIC HANDHELD | 35mm | Koss rises, taking command. He lays out the plan to fortify the Nest. The strays have found their resolve; they have a strategy. |
| | 6 | 2-SHOT | RACK FOCUS | 85mm | A shot of Ella in the foreground, looking back at Axl in the background. The focus racks from her determined face to his. They are in this together. No words needed. |
| **3-2** | 1 | MONTAGE | FAST-PACED HANDHELD | 35mm & 50mm | A fast-cut montage of the nest's transformation into a fortress: Strays building barriers, sharpening weapons, Axl practicing with his spear. The energy is high and purposeful. |
| | 2 | MEDIUM | WHIP PAN | 50mm | A scout runs into the Nest, breathless, shouting a warning. The camera whip pans to him as he arrives. The purposeful activity freezes. |
| | 3 | WIDE | STATIC HANDHELD | 35mm | The remaining fifteen fighters gather around Koss. They are a small, determined band. Koss gives his final speech. No one moves. They are ready. |
| **3-3** | 1 | WIDE | STATIC | 24mm | A cold, static shot from the strays' POV. The three enforcers and the imposing Commander Unit appear at the tunnel entrance, their forms silhouetted against the dark. The HUM of their weapons is the only sound. |
| | 2 | MONTAGE | CHAOTIC HANDHELD | 35mm & 50mm | **A brutal, fast-cut montage of the battle.** Shaky cam, tight CUs on impacts (spears hitting metal, strays falling), strays dropping from shadows. It is violent, visceral, and desperate. |
| | 3 | MEDIUM | HANDHELD (Slow Motion) | 50mm | **Slow motion.** The powerful Commander Unit moves with terrifying speed, backhanding Koss across the cave. The slow motion emphasizes its superior power and the brutal impact. |
| | 4 | CLOSE UP | HANDHELD | 50mm | The Commander has Ella cornered. Axl ROARS and charges into frame. The camera is tight on his face—no longer a pet, but a warrior consumed by protective rage. |
| | 5 | ECU | STATIC (Slow Motion) | 90mm Macro | **Slow motion.** The sharp piece of metal in Axl's hand drives into the Commander's optical sensor. A shower of sparks. A critical, disabling blow. |
| | 6 | WIDE | SHAKY HANDHELD | 24mm | An EXPLOSION from deeper in the tunnel rocks the chamber. Debris falls everywhere. The camera shakes violently as the strays make their escape. |
| | 7 | WIDE (from behind) | HANDHELD TRACKING | 35mm | The camera follows Ella pulling Axl away, running towards a secondary tunnel as the main Nest collapses behind them, burying the damaged Commander. |
| **3-4** | 1 | WIDE (Low Angle) | SLOW TILT UP | 24mm | From inside a dark ventilation shaft, the camera tilts up as the survivors climb out, their battered forms silhouetted against the slowly brightening dawn sky. |
| | 2 | EWS | SWEEPING CRANE | 24mm | **A major stylistic shift to epic beauty.** A massive, sweeping crane shot reveals the handful of survivors on the rooftop against the entire, breathtaking skyline of the android city at sunrise. The music swells. They are free. |
| | 3 | CLOSE UP | SLOW PUSH IN | 85mm | A slow push in on Axl's face as he looks out over the city that no longer owns him. He says the single, clear, defiant word: "No." It's not angry; it's a calm statement of fact. His final answer to the androids' control. |
| **3-5** | 1 | 2-SHOT | STATIC HANDHELD | 50mm | **One month later.** A calm, steady shot of Axl teaching a younger stray, Finn, how to sharpen a blade. Axl is now in the mentor role, completing his character arc. |
| | 2 | CLOSE UP | STATIC HANDHELD | 85mm | A shot on Axl's face as he explains the "better kind of scared." He is mature, thoughtful, and a leader. |
| | 3 | WIDE | SLOW PAN | 35mm | A slow pan across the new Nest. It's bustling with more life than before. The rebellion is quietly growing. |
| | 4 | CLOSE UP | SLOW PULL OUT | 85mm | A final close-up on Axl's face. He is at peace, surrounded by his pack, his family. He eats, not with hesitation, but with belonging. The camera slowly pulls out to reveal him in the heart of this new, vibrant society. **Fade to black.** |
