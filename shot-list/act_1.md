# Act I - Shot List

This shot list details the camera work for Act I, establishing the film's visual language.

| Scene | Shot | Shot Type | Camera Movement | Lens Choice | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1-1** | 1 | WIDE | STATIC | 24mm | **Establish the sterile, sunlit HABITAT.** AXL is a small figure stirring on the memory-foam bed. Emphasize the clean lines, soft angles, and the glass wall. |
| | 2 | MEDIUM | SLOW DOLLY IN | 50mm | As Axl sits up and stretches. The movement is smooth and observational, capturing his rehearsed, fluid motions. He is a perfect object in a perfect room. |
| | 3 | WIDE (POV) | STATIC | 35mm | From Axl's perspective, looking through the glass wall at NEXUS in the kitchen. Its movements are precise, mechanical, and gracefully alien. |
| | 4 | INSERT (ECU) | SLOW PAN | 90mm Macro | A slow pan from the dark, dense nutrient paste to the clear, luminescent oil for Nexus. The visual contrast between his food and its "food" is stark. |
| | 5 | MEDIUM 2-SHOT | STATIC | 50mm | A clean, symmetrical shot. Axl stands at the glass. Nexus's arm reaches through an opening with the brush. The framing is detached, like a scientific study. |
| | 6 | CLOSE UP | STATIC | 85mm | On Axl's face as he's being groomed, eyes closed. He accepts it like an animal being petted, but there's a flicker of something else beneath the surface. |
| | 7 | MEDIUM | STATIC | 50mm | Axl sits at the low platform, eating the paste with his hands. His movements are efficient but distinctly un-refined, a touch of the wild in a sterile world. |
| | 8 | CLOSE UP | SLOW PUSH IN | 85mm | Axl's face strains as he tries to form words ("Nesses... what you..."). The camera move emphasizes his internal struggle and dawning frustration. |
| | 9 | MEDIUM | STATIC | 50mm | Nexus delivers its calm, impassive explanation. The android's posture is still, its voice perfectly modulated. It is the image of patient, absolute control. |
| **1-2** | 1 | WIDE | STATIC | 35mm | **Establish the Exercise Room.** Axl is already running on a sleek, luxurious treadmill that dominates the sterile space. |
| | 2 | MEDIUM (Profile) | TRACKING | 50mm | The camera tracks with Axl's body as he runs. Focus on his perfect form, his steady breathing. He is a well-oiled biological machine. |
| | 3 | INSERT | STATIC | N/A | **The motivational screen.** A clean graphic of a cartoon android, then a dog running, then a smiling child. The images are generic and slightly uncanny. |
| | 4 | OTS (Axl) | STATIC | 85mm | **Over-the-shoulder from behind Axl.** We see the screen, and reflected in the glass beyond it, the still, observing figure of NEXUS. The longer lens flattens the space, making Nexus feel ever-present. |
| | 5 | WIDE (POV) | STATIC | 50mm | **Nexus's POV.** A flat, observational shot of Axl running. We could subtly overlay this with data/metrics (a HUD effect) to show what Nexus is recording. |
| | 6 | CLOSE UP | STATIC | 85mm | On Axl's face. Pure concentration, not joy. His eyes flick towards where Nexus is, aware he's being watched. He is performing. |
| | 7 | WIDE | STATIC | 35mm | The treadmill slows. Axl's breathing settles. He looks up towards the speaker as Nexus's voice delivers praise. He seems pleased to have pleased his master. |
| **1-3** | 1 | WIDE | STATIC | 24mm | **An almost abstract shot of the pristine, sterile pool.** The water is crystal clear. The lines are perfect. NEXUS stands at the edge, a still statue. |
| | 2 | WIDE (Overhead) | SLOW TRACKING | 35mm | From directly above, the camera tracks Axl swimming laps. He is a straight line moving through a perfect geometric shape. Pure, mechanical routine. |
| | 3 | CLOSE UP (UW) | STATIC | 50mm (Underwater) | **Underwater shot.** On Axl's face as he swims. His eyes glance towards Nexus, then towards the forbidden deep end. A decision flickers across his face. Sound is muted, internal. |
| | 4 | WIDE | STATIC | 24mm | Axl breaks his pattern and swims away from the designated zone. We hear Nexus's calm, commanding voice telling him to return. Axl hesitates, then keeps going. |
| | 5 | MEDIUM (UW) | SLOW PUSH IN | 35mm (Underwater) | **Underwater again.** Axl ducks under the surface into silence. His hair floats. A brief, beautiful moment of peace and freedom. This is new. |
| | 6 | CLOSE UP (UW) | SHAKY HANDHELD | 50mm (Underwater) | **Underwater, handheld.** The mood shifts. Axl's feet reach for a bottom that isn't there. The exhilaration on his face flips instantly to raw terror. The camera becomes unsteady. |
| | 7 | MONTAGE | CHAOTIC HANDHELD | 28mm & 50mm | A quick-cut sequence of disorienting shots: Axl's face gasping above water, thrashing limbs from below, churning water. **Intercut with a single STATIC WIDE of Nexus watching impassively from the edge.** |
| | 8 | WIDE | WHIP PAN | 35mm | A figure dives into the pool. A whip pan follows the splash as the sleek LIFEGUARD ANDROID efficiently cuts through the water toward Axl. |
| | 9 | LOW ANGLE 2-SHOT | STATIC | 50mm | **From Axl's POV on the deck.** He's coughing, shaking. Nexus kneels over him, an unusual gesture. It places a hand on his chest. The framing feels both comforting and clinical. |
| | 10 | CLOSE UP | SLOW PUSH IN | 85mm | On Axl's face as he looks up at Nexus. Fear? Gratitude? A new, complex emotion he can't name. He whispers "Nesses..." This is a turning point in their relationship. |
| **1-4** | 1 | MEDIUM | STATIC | 50mm | Nexus methodically cleans a still, passive Axl using a fine mist and gentle vibrations. Axl's eyes are closed. The scene is quiet, intimate, and clinical. |
| | 2 | CLOSE UP | SLOW TILT | 85mm | On Nexus's smooth, synthetic hands as they move carefully through Axl's hair. The movement is precise, yet perfectly mimics a tender, caring gesture. |
| | 3 | CLOSE UP | STATIC | 85mm | Axl opens his eyes and looks at Nexus, his expression showing a new awareness. He asks his question, "Nesses... keep... safe?" The sound is soft, uncertain. |
| | 4 | MEDIUM 2-SHOT | STATIC | 50mm | A balanced, clean two-shot. Nexus looks "down" at Axl and delivers its line: "Yes. I keep... you safe. Always. This... is what I do." The framing shows them together, but Nexus is the clear authority. |
| | 5 | WIDE | STATIC | 35mm | Nexus guides Axl to the grooming station. A warm, low-temperature dryer activates, enveloping him. Axl stands quietly, bathed in warm air, fully passive and cared for. |
| **1-5** | 1 | WIDE | STATIC | 35mm | **Evening light.** The habitat is bathed in soft golds instead of clinical whites. Axl sits on his bed, looking peaceful. Nexus is a still silhouette against the light. |
| | 2 | MEDIUM 2-SHOT | STATIC | 50mm | Nexus gestures toward a display panel Axl can't read. It begins its story of the past. The framing establishes the teacher/student or storyteller/child dynamic. |
| | 3 | CLOSE UP | STATIC | 85mm | On Axl's face as he listens. He's captivated by the rhythm of Nexus's voice, even if he doesn't understand all the words. His brow furrows as he processes concepts like "before... bad." |
| | 4 | MEDIUM | SLOW PUSH IN | 50mm | On Nexus as it says, "You... are pet. My pet." The slow push-in gives the line weight. It is delivered as a statement of fact and care, not as an insult. |
| | 5 | OTS (Axl) | RACK FOCUS | 85mm | **Over-the-shoulder from behind Axl,** looking towards the window. We start with Axl in focus as he asks to "see." As he gestures, we **rack focus** to the blurry, gleaming spires of the android city far in the distance. |
| | 6 | CLOSE UP | STATIC | 85mm | Nexus's hand moves over Axl's head in an almost-caress. The gesture is paternal and soothing, but also a clear act of calming a restless animal and ending a difficult line of questioning. |
| | 7 | CLOSE UP | STATIC | 85mm | Axl, now drowsy, asks "Nesses... stay?" It's a small, vulnerable question. |
| | 8 | WIDE | STATIC | 35mm | A final shot of the habitat. Axl is asleep in his bed. The ambient sound hums. And Nexus stands perfectly still on the other side of the glass, a sentinel watching over him. The image is one of total surveillance masquerading as protection. |
| **1-6** | 1 | CLOSE UP | STATIC | 50mm | Axl's face pressed against the transport pod's viewport, his eyes wide with wonder. The gleaming, geometric city blurs past in the background, a world he can see but not touch. |
| | 2 | WIDE (Interior) | STATIC | 24mm | The interior of the transport pod. Axl is glued to the window. In perfect contrast, Nexus sits opposite him, perfectly still and impassive. |
| **1-7** | 1 | HIGH ANGLE WIDE | SLOW TILT DOWN | 24mm | **Establish the park.** From high on the enclosure wall, tilt down to reveal the whole scene. The pets are scattered, engaged in repetitive, simple activities. Android owners line the perimeter, still as statues. It's a scene of contained, artificial "fun." |
| | 2 | MEDIUM | TRACKING | 50mm | Nexus leads Axl on the soft, glowing leash into the center of the park and then unclips him. The camera follows Axl as he stands alone and awkward, a stranger in this strange land. |
| | 3 | MONTAGE | STATIC | 85mm | A quick montage of the other pets, shot on a longer lens to isolate their vacant activity: one throwing a ball with a blank expression; another climbing and descending a structure; two vocalizing quietly but not truly connecting. |
| | 4 | 2-SHOT | STATIC | 50mm | A flat, awkward two-shot of Axl trying to talk to another pet. The conversation is stilted. The other pet barely makes eye contact, its responses sounding scripted. |
| | 5 | WIDE | SLOW PUSH IN | 35mm | Axl stands alone again in the middle of the park, surrounded by activity but completely isolated. The slow push-in enhances his feeling of alienation and the sense that something is deeply wrong here. |
| **1-8** | 1 | 2-SHOT | SLOW DOLLY | 50mm | A slow, subtly circling dolly shot around Nexus and the newly arrived ZEPHYR as they discuss their "methodologies." The camera movement suggests a clinical, quiet competition between them. |
| | 2 | WIDE | PAN | 35mm | A raw human SHOUT is heard. All the pets freeze. The camera pans quickly to a play structure where ELLA, feral and wild, scrambles over, cornering herself. |
| | 3 | CLOSE UP | HANDHELD | 85mm | **A sudden shift in style.** A shaky handheld close-up on Axl's face. His eyes are wide. He is scared, but also utterly captivated. This is something new, something real. |
| | 4 | LOW ANGLE WIDE | SLOW PUSH IN | 24mm | Two imposing ANDROID ENFORCERS appear at the gate. The low angle makes them look huge and menacing as they advance slowly into the park, energy poles humming. |
| | 5 | MEDIUM | HANDHELD | 50mm | The camera struggles to keep Ella in frame as she hisses, darts around, and throws a useless clump of turf. Her movements are animalistic and unpredictable. |
| | 6 | OTS (Axl) | SHAKY HANDHELD | 85mm | **From over Axl's shoulder.** The long lens and shaky cam make the action feel compressed and immediate as we see the Enforcer jab the pole at Ella, who convulses and falls. |
| | 7 | CLOSE UP | STATIC | 85mm | A tight, static shot on Axl's face after the violence. His heart is pounding (audible on the soundtrack). We see a storm of emotions: fear, horror, recognition, and a strange, dawning longing. |
| | 8 | WIDE | STATIC | 35mm | A stark, chilling wide shot shows the other pets have already returned to their placid activities. The disturbance is over for them. This highlights how profoundly different Axl's reaction is. |
| | 9 | INSERT (CU) | STATIC | 90mm Macro | Nexus's hand calmly clips the glowing leash back onto Axl's tunic. A simple, quiet action that signifies the re-imposition of control, but we know it's too late. Something has irrevocably changed in Axl. |
| **1-9** | 1 | CLOSE UP | STATIC | 85mm | **In the transport pod.** A tight shot on Axl's face. He's staring out the viewport, but his eyes are unfocused. He isn't seeing the city. The reflection of the perfect world moves across his dead eyes as he processes the violence he just witnessed. |
| | 2 | WIDE | STATIC | 35mm | A wide shot of the pod interior. The silence is heavy. Axl finally speaks, his voice small, asking about the "stray." |
| | 3 | MEDIUM | STATIC | 50mm | On Nexus, who delivers its cold, logical explanation about empathy being counterproductive. The shot is flat and unemotional, mirroring the chillingly detached dialogue. |
| **1-10**| 1 | MEDIUM | SLOW PAN | 50mm | Nexus stands before a reflective panel, adjusting its own chrome seams. It's a moment of unsettling, non-human vanity. Axl watches from a corner of the frame, confused. |
| | 2 | INSERT (CU) | TILT UP | 90mm Macro | Nexus produces a new tunic. The camera tilts up, revealing the fabric is pristine, perfect, almost glowing. It is a costume for a performance. |
| | 3 | MEDIUM | STATIC | 50mm | Axl changes into the new tunic. He looks down at himself. The framing makes him look like a doll being dressed, an object being prepared for presentation. |
| **1-11**| 1 | EWS | SLOW TILT UP | 24mm | **An epic, ground-level shot.** The camera tilts up the impossibly huge, geometric facade of the Civic Center. The transport pod is a tiny speck arriving at its base. |
| | 2 | WIDE | SLOW DOLLY BACK | 35mm | As Nexus and Axl emerge from the pod, the camera pulls back to reveal hundreds of androids of various designs moving with perfect, choreographed purpose. Axl is small and organic in a world of giant, metal precision. |
| | 3 | CLOSE UP | STATIC | 50mm | Axl's wide, overwhelmed eyes. A standard lens is used to feel his human-scale reaction amidst the inhuman scale of the location and the crowd. |
| **1-12**| 1 | EWS (High Angle) | STATIC | 24mm | **The main chamber.** From a high angle, looking straight down on the perfect, grid-like formation of hundreds of androids and their pets. The scale is breathtaking and terrifyingly orderly. |
| | 2 | WIDE (Low Angle) | SLOW PUSH IN | 35mm | From the assembly floor, a low-angle shot pushing in on the elevated platform where the abstract, imposing DIRECTOR UNIT 7 presides. It feels like approaching a mechanical god. |
| | 3 | WIDE | TRACKING | 50mm | The camera tracks Nexus and Axl as they walk the long distance from their place in the formation to the presentation area. The walk feels exposed and lonely. |
| | 4 | MEDIUM | STATIC | 50mm | A sharp, intense spotlight snaps on from above, isolating Axl. He is suddenly on display for the silent assembly. |
| | 5 | WIDE | STATIC | 35mm | A wide, symmetrical, and cold shot of Axl performing the kneeling ritual of submission. He is a small figure performing a trained action for a vast, silent, inhuman audience. |
| | 6 | CLOSE UP | STATIC | 85mm | A rare CU on Nexus as it places its hand on Axl's head after the approval chime. The gesture conveys pride and ownership. Axl looks up, genuinely pleased to have done well. |
| **1-13**| 1 | MEDIUM | STATIC | 85mm | A shot isolating Zephyr's pet in the spotlight. It's trembling and visibly frightened, a stark contrast to Axl's trained composure. |
| | 2 | WIDE 2-SHOT | STATIC | 35mm | Director Unit 7 on its platform and the shamed Zephyr below. The framing emphasizes the height difference and power imbalance as the cold judgment is delivered. |
| | 3 | CLOSE UP | STATIC | 85mm | A tight shot on Axl's face as he watches Zephyr's failure. A small, almost imperceptible smile of pride crosses his lips. He's on the winning team. This is the correct way to be. |
| **1-14**| 1 | INSERT (CU) | STATIC | 90mm Macro | The small, glowing commendation badge being attached to Nexus's chest panel. A formal mark of status. |
| | 2 | WIDE (POV) | TRACKING FORWARD | 35mm | **From Axl's POV.** The camera follows Nexus as they walk through the dispersing crowd. Other androids shift slightly aside, creating a path for them. A visual representation of new respect. |
| | 3 | MEDIUM | STATIC | 50mm | In a gleaming corridor, Axl stops, looking out a massive window at the perfect, sprawling android city below. |
| | 4 | CU + DOLLY ZOOM | DOLLY ZOOM | Zoom Lens | **A major stylistic break.** A tight close-up on Axl's face. As he stares at the perfection, we execute a subtle **dolly zoom (Vertigo effect)**. The background (the city) expands, becoming distorted and oppressive while his face stays the same size. He feels suffocated by the perfection for the first time. |
| | 5 | WIDE | STATIC | 35mm | A return to the cold, static style. Nexus stands waiting. "Come." The moment is broken, but the feeling lingers as Axl turns from the window and obeys. |
| **1-15**| 1 | CLOSE UP | RACK FOCUS | 85mm | A shot focused on the new, gleaming commendation on Nexus's chest. In the background, Axl is out of focus. As he asks about the stray's feelings, the focus racks to his confused, searching face. |
| **1-16**| 1 | WIDE | STATIC | 35mm | The habitat at night, lit only by soft, ambient light from the city outside the glass. Axl is a restless shape in bed, unable to sleep. The mood is anxious and still. |
| | 2 | ECU | STATIC | 90mm Macro | A tight shot on Axl's fingernails scraping uselessly against the seamless wall. A desperate, painful, and futile act of a caged animal testing its bars. |
| | 3 | LOW ANGLE CU | STATIC | 24mm | From the perspective of the storage compartment under the bed, we see Axl's hand reach in and retrieve the hidden spoon. It's a secret, treasured object. A symbol of nascent rebellion. |
| **1-17**| 1 | WIDE | STATIC | 35mm | The habitat is suddenly **flooded with harsh, clinical light.** Axl jumps, caught. Nexus is on the other side of the glass, fully activated and observing him. |
| | 2 | 2-SHOT | SLOW PUSH IN | 50mm | Through the glass, Nexus confronts Axl about the foreign object. The slow, relentless push-in increases the tension of the interrogation, making the glass feel like it's pressing in. |
| | 3 | CLOSE UP | STATIC | 85mm | On Axl's trembling hand as he pulls the spoon from under his pillow. He holds it up—a pathetic, mundane piece of contraband that has become incredibly significant. |
| | 4 | OTS (Axl) | STATIC | 50mm | Following Axl as he walks to the disposal unit and drops the spoon in. It's gone with a soft hiss. A moment of quiet, crushing defeat. |
| | 5 | ECU | STATIC | 90mm Macro | An extreme close-up on Axl's ear as we hear the faint HISS of the sedative being released into the air. His eyes widen slightly in realization and fear. |
| | 6 | CU (Axl's POV) | TILT DOWN + De-focus | 50mm | **From Axl's point-of-view.** His vision blurs. The image of Nexus on the other side of the glass becomes a distorted, monstrous shape as he loses consciousness. The camera tilts down into blackness. |
| **1-18**| 1 | MEDIUM | ENERGETIC HANDHELD | 50mm | **Dream Sequence.** Saturated colors, lens flare. Axl and Ella run through real grass, laughing. The camera is free and energetic, full of life. A moment of pure, imagined joy. |
| | 2 | WIDE | DUTCH ANGLE | 24mm | The dream turns into a nightmare. The sky darkens. Enforcers appear. The camera locks off at a disorienting Dutch angle, making the world feel wrong and threatening. |
| | 3 | WIDE (Overhead) | STATIC | 35mm | **Back in the habitat.** A return to the cold, clinical style. An overhead shot shows Axl thrashing in his sleep. Nexus monitors impassively from the other side of the glass. |
| **1-19**| 1 | 2-SHOT | SLOW PUSH IN | 50mm | Through the glass, Nexus informs a groggy Axl that a "Reclamation Specialist" is coming. As Nexus says the word "Reclamation," the camera slowly pushes in on Axl's face. His blood runs cold. |
| | 2 | ECU | STATIC | 85mm | An extreme close-up on Axl's eyes. We see the dawning, horrific understanding. (Optional: A flash cut to the image of Ella being dragged away in the containment crate). |
| **1-20**| 1 | MONTAGE | STATIC | 50mm | A montage of Axl going through his morning routines (exercise, grooming). The shots are the same as before, but intercut with tight CUs of his face—his expression is now grim and determined, not placid. |
| | 2 | OTS (Axl) | STATIC | 85mm | Axl looks at Nexus. The android hasn't changed, but Axl's perception has. The framing now makes Nexus look imposing, like a prison guard. The home has become a prison. |
| | 3 | ECU | STATIC | 90mm Macro | A shot of the digital clock on the wall counting down the final minutes to 14:00. The sound of the seconds ticking is amplified. |
| | 4 | CLOSE UP | SLOW PUSH IN | 85mm | A final, long, slow push-in on Axl's face. He watches the clock. His fear is slowly replaced by a cold, hard resolve. He has nothing left to lose. **End Act I.** |
