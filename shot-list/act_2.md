# Act II - Shot List

This shot list details the camera work for Act II. The cinematic style shifts dramatically to be more handheld, visceral, and chaotic, reflecting Axl's escape and discovery of the world outside.

| Scene | Shot | Shot Type | Camera Movement | Lens Choice | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **2-1** | 1 | MEDIUM | STATIC | 50mm | A return to the cold, static style. Axl sits on his bed, perfectly still and compliant. But his eyes are alert, waiting. The calm before the storm. |
| | 2 | ECU | STATIC | 90mm Macro | The clock on the wall reads 13:55. The numbers are stark. The sound of the seconds ticking is amplified, building extreme tension. |
| | 3 | 2-SHOT | STATIC | 50mm | Through the glass, Nexus speaks its almost-affectionate "goodbye." A final moment of their strange, complex relationship. |
| | 4 | CLOSE UP | RACK FOCUS | 85mm | On Axl's face. We hear a soft CHIME (O.S.) as the specialist arrives. His eyes dart. Nexus turns its back. We rack focus to Nexus walking away. This is the moment. |
| | 5 | MEDIUM | **HANDHELD** | 35mm | **Style Shift.** The camera is now handheld. Axl explodes into action, grabbing the bowl. The camera whips with him as he hurls it at the glass wall. |
| | 6 | CLOSE UP | CHAOTIC HANDHELD | 35mm | A tight, shaky, claustrophobic shot on the pet door lock as Axl jams a shard into it. Sparks fly. The alarm BEEPS. The handheld camera conveys his frantic energy. |
| | 7 | LOW ANGLE | HANDHELD | 24mm | From the floor, Axl throws his body against the damaged door. It slides open. He scrambles through the gap, scraping his shoulder. The camera is low, emphasizing the desperate struggle to be free. |
| **2-2** | 1 | MEDIUM | HANDHELD | 35mm | Axl tumbles onto the narrow catwalk. The camera tumbles with him, finding its footing as he does. It's disorienting and chaotic. |
| | 2 | WIDE (POV) | SHAKY TILT DOWN | 24mm | **Axl's POV.** A shaky, terrifying tilt down the side of the skyscraper to the city hundreds of stories below. The sound of wind rushes in. Vertigo hits hard. |
| | 3 | 2-SHOT | HANDHELD | 50mm | Nexus appears in the habitat opening, yelling. Axl looks back at his impassive jailer, then at the endless, terrifying catwalk. He makes his choice. |
| | 4 | WIDE (from behind) | HANDHELD TRACKING | 35mm | The camera follows Axl as he runs, his figure small and vulnerable against the massive scale of the city architecture. He is free, but also utterly exposed. |
| **2-3** | 1 | MEDIUM | HANDHELD TRACKING | 35mm | The camera follows Axl closely as he navigates a maze of cold, metallic service corridors. He is constantly looking over his shoulder. The sound of distant alarms echoes, creating a sense of being hunted. |
| | 2 | CLOSE UP | SHAKY HANDHELD | 50mm | A shaky close-up on his bare, bleeding feet slapping against the cold steel gratings. Then a shot of his arm scraping against a sharp metal edge. The escape is physically costly. |
| | 3 | WIDE | STATIC | 24mm | A rare static shot. Axl is a small, frantic figure running down a long, perfectly symmetrical but decaying service alley. He is still trapped, just in a different kind of prison grid. The shot emphasizes his isolation. |
| **2-4** | 1 | MEDIUM | HANDHELD | 50mm | Axl stumbles into a dark alley and collapses behind rusted power cells. The camera collapses with him, staying low to the ground, emphasizing his exhaustion, pain, and vulnerability. |
| | 2 | WIDE | STATIC HANDHELD | 35mm (Shallow Focus) | Axl is a crumpled figure in the foreground. In the background, deep in the shadows, blurry shapes begin to emerge, moving silently and surrounding him. |
| | 3 | MEDIUM | SLOW PUSH IN | 85mm | ELLA steps out of the shadows, sharp metal in hand. Her eyes are intense, her movements predatory. The camera slowly pushes in on her, establishing her as the leader and the primary threat. |
| | 4 | WIDE (POV) | SLOW PAN | 35mm | From Axl's low-angle POV, the camera does a slow, nervous pan, revealing the silent, watchful faces of the strays who have him completely surrounded. |
| | 5 | OTS (Axl) | HANDHELD | 50mm | Over Axl's shoulder as Ella questions him. Her face is a mask of calculation and curiosity. We feel his vulnerability as she studies his clean tunic and un-scarred skin. |
| | 6 | CLOSE UP | STATIC HANDHELD | 85mm | A tight, intimate, and raw shot on Axl's face as he whispers the first word he has ever truly owned: "Help." |
| | 7 | WIDE | STATIC HANDHELD | 35mm | Ella makes her decision. She turns and walks away, disappearing into the deep shadows. Axl scrambles to his feet. He looks back at the distant, gleaming android city, then turns and follows Ella into the darkness. He has made his choice. |
| **2-10**| 1 | MEDIUM 2-SHOT | HANDHELD | 50mm | Ella approaches Axl in his new, personal sleeping area and gives him a spear she made. The spear physically connects them in the frame. A symbol of trust and partnership. |
| | 2 | CLOSE UP | STATIC HANDHELD | 85mm | A tight shot on Axl's face as Ella tells him, "You're not a pet anymore." He processes this profound, definitive statement. |
| | 3 | CLOSE UP | STATIC HANDHELD | 50mm | Axl sits alone, holding the spear. He runs his thumb over the rough, imperfect wrapping. He owns something real. |
| **2-11**| 1 | WIDE | MOVING HANDHELD | 35mm | The Nest is a hive of activity. The handheld camera moves through the space, capturing the purposeful energy of the strays preparing for the scavenging mission. |
| **2-12**| 1 | WIDE | HANDHELD TRACKING | 24mm | The camera follows the group as they enter the cavernous, ruined market tunnel. The wide lens captures the scale of the decaying, pre-android world. |
| | 2 | CLOSE UP | WHIP PAN | 85mm | A tight CU on Ella's face. She freezes, hearing something. The camera whip pans to a dark tunnel entrance as the distant, unmistakable whine of an enforcer is heard. |
| | 3 | MEDIUM | FRANTIC HANDHELD | 35mm | **A chaotic chase.** The camera is tight on the characters' faces as they run through the dark tunnels, trying to keep up. We feel their panic and hear their ragged breaths. |
| **2-13**| 1 | 2-SHOT | STATIC HANDHELD | 50mm | Back at the Nest, Koss sits with Axl by the fire. The shot is steady and intimate. Koss delivers his warning about the "cost of freedom" and the temptation of comfort. |
| | 2 | CLOSE UP | STATIC HANDHELD | 85mm | A final CU on Axl's face, lit by the fire. He looks at his calloused hands, then at Ella across the fire. He understands the choice he has to keep making every day. **End Act II.** |
| **2-5** | 1 | WIDE (Low Angle) | STATIC | 24mm | The entrance to the ancient subway tunnel is a black, gaping mouth in the earth. Ella stands at the edge, a silhouette against the last of the dying city light. |
| | 2 | MEDIUM (from behind) | HANDHELD TILT DOWN | 35mm | The camera follows closely behind Axl as he descends the stairs after Ella. The city light disappears, plunging the screen into near-total blackness, with only their faint silhouettes visible. |
| **2-6** | 1 | WIDE (Axl's POV) | SLOW PAN | 35mm | **From Axl's POV.** The camera enters the vast, dark chamber. It pans slowly, revealing the scene as he sees it: the central fire, the huge overturned subway car, and the shadowy figures of twenty strays who all stop and turn to look, their faces lit by flickering firelight. |
| | 2 | MONTAGE | STATIC | 85mm | A quick montage of the strays' faces—weathered, scarred, wary, curious—all looking at the newcomer, their expressions illuminated by the dancing fire. |
| | 3 | 3-SHOT | HANDHELD | 50mm | Koss explains the rules to Axl, with Ella standing by. The framing is tight, emphasizing the seriousness of this new society's protocol. |
| | 4 | CLOSE UP | SLOW PUSH IN | 85mm | An ECU on Axl's mouth as he hesitantly eats the "real food." His expression changes—it's unfamiliar, maybe even terrible, but it's also *real*. He chews slowly, processing the new sensation. |
| | 5 | WIDE | STATIC | 35mm | A final wide shot of the Nest. Axl sits by the fire, now part of the scene. Around him, the community has returned to its work. He looks across the fire at Ella, who gives him a slight nod. The shot is dark and full of shadow, but feels warm from the fire. This is his new home. |
| **2-7** | 1 | WIDE | STATIC | 24mm | Koss and Axl emerge into a massive underground chamber. Shafts of daylight from high above illuminate a beautiful, natural, flowing stream—a secret oasis. A stark contrast to the sterile pool from Act I. |
| | 2 | LOW ANGLE CU | STATIC HANDHELD | 50mm | From just above the water's surface, Axl cups the cold, clear water in his hands and drinks. A moment of pure, natural baptism into his new life. |
| | 3 | 2-SHOT | STATIC HANDHELD | 50mm | Koss and Axl sit by the water. The shot is calm and steady as Koss tells his story and points to his scarred leg. A quiet moment of mentorship. |
| **2-8** | 1 | CLOSE UP | TILT DOWN | 50mm | Axl holds his old, clean pet tunic. He looks at it one last time, then drops it. The camera tilts down with the tunic as it falls into the fire and is consumed by the flames. |
| | 2 | MEDIUM | STATIC | 85mm | From across the fire, Ella watches Axl burn his past. She gives a single, subtle nod of approval. He has passed a test. |
| **2-9** | 1 | INSERT (ECU) | STATIC | 90mm Macro | Ella's finger points to the spots on a mushroom. Her voice is clear: "Dark spots: good. White spots: poison." A simple, life-or-death lesson. |
| | 2 | CLOSE UP | HANDHELD | 50mm | Axl's face, full of intense concentration and fear, as he tries to identify a mushroom himself. He second-guesses. The weight of this new, deadly responsibility is on his face. |
| | 3 | WIDE | HANDHELD | 35mm | Axl is now part of the foraging group, a canvas bag in hand. He's clumsy and slow, but he is actively participating, learning, and contributing. He is becoming one of them. |
