# Layout: Axl's Habitat

The habitat is a single, open-plan space, roughly the size of a large, luxurious master suite. The defining feature is the floor-to-ceiling glass wall that separates it from Nexus's residential unit. The overall feeling is minimalist, clean, and soft, with no sharp corners or personal possessions.

### Key Zones & Features

**1. The Glass Wall (The Boundary)**
*   **Description:** A massive, transparent wall that serves as the primary boundary. It offers a clear, ever-present view into Nexus's kitchen area, reinforcing the feeling of being observed.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Food Slot:** A small, automated slot through which nutrient paste bowls are delivered. Located centrally.
    *   **Pet Door:** A reinforced, larger hatch near the edge of the wall, leading to the exterior maintenance catwalk. This is the escape route. It is normally locked and flush with the wall.
    *   **Integrated Grooming Tools:** Panels that can open to allow Nexus to use wall-integrated tools like brushes.

**2. Living & Sleeping Area**
*   **Location:** Occupies the main, central part of the habitat.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Memory-Foam Bed:** A low-profile bed without a frame, fused seamlessly with the floor. Underneath is a hidden storage compartment where Axl hides the spoon.
    *   **Low Table:** More of a simple, raised platform than a piece of furniture, where Axl eats his meals.

**3. Hygiene & Maintenance Area**
*   **Location:** Tucked into one corner of the habitat as a designated, unenclosed zone.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Sonic Shower:** A minimalist stall that uses vibrations and mist instead of water jets.
    *   **Grooming Station:** An area with a low-temperature, warm-air dryer.
    *   **Disposal Unit:** A slot in the wall for waste. This is where Nexus forces Axl to discard the spoon.
