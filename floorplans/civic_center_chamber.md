# Layout: Android Civic Center - Main Chamber

This chamber is the heart of android authority and ceremony. The design is intended to project power, precision, and overwhelming scale. It is a place of judgment.

---

### Key Characteristics

*   **Scale:** The chamber is vast and cavernous, with impossibly high ceilings that are mostly lost in shadow. The sense of scale is designed to make any individual (especially a human) feel insignificant.
*   **Acoustics:** The space is unnaturally quiet, with every sound absorbed by the architecture, except for the persistent, low HUM of the building's systems. Voices do not echo; they are just consumed by the space.
*   **Lighting:** The general lighting is stark and clinical. Key moments are punctuated by sharp, focused spotlights that fall from the ceiling.

### Layout & Key Zones

The layout is rigid, geometric, and focused on a single point of authority.

**1. The Platform**
*   **Location:** At the far end of the chamber, elevated several feet off the main floor.
*   **Description:** A wide, minimalist stage made of the same seamless, metallic material as the rest of the chamber. It is devoid of any decoration.
*   **Function:** This is the focal point of the entire room. Director Unit 7 stands here, delivering judgments.

**2. The Presentation Area**
*   **Location:** The space directly in front of the platform.
*   **Function:** When an android and their pet are called forward, they walk to this spot. A spotlight from above illuminates them, making them the center of attention for the entire assembly. This is where Axl is judged.

**3. The Assembly Floor**
*   **Location:** The main, vast floor of the chamber.
*   **Description:** An enormous, flat plain. On this floor, hundreds of Android Caretakers stand in perfect, grid-like formations.
*   **Function:** The androids and their pets form a silent, observing army. Their perfect silence and stillness create an atmosphere of immense pressure and scrutiny. The pets are arranged next to their caretakers, forming a secondary, more fidgety grid.

**4. Entrance**
*   **Location:** A massive, stark opening at the end of the chamber opposite the platform.
*   **Description:** There are no ornate doors, just a huge, rectangular void from which the androids file in and out in perfect order.
