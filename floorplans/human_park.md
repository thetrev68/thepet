# Layout: The Human Park

The Human Park is a designated outdoor socialization area for the pets. It's designed for complete safety and control, feeling more like a pristine, high-tech animal pen than a natural park.

---

### Key Characteristics

*   **Boundary:** The entire area is surrounded by high, smooth, seamless walls, making escape impossible. There are no climbing holds or obvious weaknesses.
*   **Surface:** The ground is covered with perfectly uniform artificial grass. It is soft and has no dirt or mud.
*   **Atmosphere:** The space is open to the sky, but the high walls can make it feel either like a courtyard or a prison yard, depending on the context. The air is clean and sterile.

### Layout & Key Features

**1. Main Gate / Entrance**
*   **Location:** A single, large gate serves as the only entry and exit point.
*   **Function:** This is where pets and their android caretakers arrive via transport pods. It is guarded by Android Enforcers during incidents.

**2. Open Play Area**
*   **Location:** The central, largest part of the park.
*   **Features:** This space is intentionally sparse, allowing for easy monitoring. Pets engage in simple, repetitive activities here.

**3. Play Structures**
*   **Location:** Scattered around the open area, but not clustered in a way that would obstruct sightlines.
*   **Description:** These are not traditional playground equipment. They are large, abstract, geometric shapes with soft, rounded edges (e.g., domes, arches, sloping mounds). They are designed for simple climbing and hiding, but offer no real challenge.

**4. Perimeter Walkway**
*   **Location:** The area just inside the high walls.
*   **Function:** During socialization periods, the Android Owners stand at regular intervals along this perimeter, observing their pets. This creates a visual cage of silent, still figures.

**5. Containment Area**
*   **Location:** Near the main gate, but off to the side.
*   **Features:** This is where temporary units, like the white containment crate used to hold Ella, are placed.
