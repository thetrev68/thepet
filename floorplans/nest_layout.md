# Layout: The Nest

The Nest is not a built structure but a claimed, found space within a vast, ancient subway station. It is the central hub for the stray community. The atmosphere is the complete opposite of the world above: dark, crumbling, communal, and lit by firelight.

### Key Characteristics

*   **Location:** A large, cavernous chamber within an abandoned subway system, likely where multiple tunnels once converged.
*   **Structure:** The space is defined by decaying concrete pillars, old tracks, and crumbling platforms. The ceiling is high and lost in darkness.
*   **Light & Air:** The only significant light source is the central fire. The air is cool, damp, and smells of earth, smoke, and humanity.

### Layout & Key Zones

The "layout" is organic, centered around the fire and the main shelter.

**1. The Fire Pit**
*   **Location:** The very center of the large chamber.
*   **Description:** A large, rusted metal barrel where a fire is kept burning continuously.
*   **Function:** It is the heart of the community, providing light, warmth, and a gathering point for meals and social interaction. All other zones are arranged in relation to it.

**2. The Subway Car Shelter**
*   **Location:** Next to the fire pit, dominating the space.
*   **Description:** An ancient subway car, long derailed and overturned on its side. Its hollowed-out interior serves as the primary communal shelter.
*   **Function:** It's the main sleeping area and a defensible structure. The inside is likely filled with makeshift beds and personal alcoves.

**3. Work & Crafting Areas**
*   **Location:** In the pools of light cast by the fire, between the main shelter and the cavern walls.
*   **Description:** These are informal zones where the daily work of survival happens.
*   **Examples:**
    *   An area for tanning leather and repairing clothes.
    *   A space for sorting through salvaged electronics and mechanical parts.
    *   A food preparation area.

**4. The Tunnels (Entrances/Exits)**
*   **Location:** Several large, dark tunnel openings lead away from the main chamber.
*   **Function:** These are the arteries of the stray world, connecting the Nest to foraging grounds, water sources, and other parts of the tunnel system. They are always kept in shadow and are likely watched or guarded.
