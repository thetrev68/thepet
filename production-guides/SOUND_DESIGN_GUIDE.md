# The Pet - Sound Design Guide

Comprehensive audio landscape, ambience, and sonic philosophy for pre-production planning.

## SOUND DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

The sound world mirrors the visual world: artificial precision in Act I, organic chaos in Act II, and blended synthesis in Act III. Sound is not decoration—it is a primary storytelling tool that shapes audience perception of space, time, and psychological state.

### Core Principle
**Sound = Consciousness**

- Act I: Axl only hears what Nexus permits; his auditory world is controlled and limited
- Act II: Axl is bombarded with overwhelming sensory input; survival means learning to filter
- Act III: Axl selectively processes sound; he is in control of his acoustic environment

---

## ACT I: DOMESTICATION (Artificial, Controlled, Precise)

### Base Soundscape Characteristics
- **Frequency Balance:** Elevated midrange (1-4 kHz); reduced low and high frequencies
- **Reverb:** Minimal, dry; sound dies quickly (acoustic dead space)
- **Noise Floor:** Silent; absolute absence of unwanted sound
- **Dynamics:** Controlled; nothing sudden or jarring
- **Mechanical Undertone:** Subtle servo hum, electrical buzz present in all spaces

### Location-Specific Sounds

#### Habitat (Primary Act I Location)

**Ambient Hum:**
- 60Hz electrical hum (barely perceptible)
- Servo micro-movements (0.5-2 kHz, -40dB)
- Air circulation system (low frequency whoosh, -50dB)
- Combined effect: Never truly silent, but peaceful

**Grooming/Maintenance Sounds:**
- Brush bristles on hair (2-4 kHz, soft)
- Synthetic fabric movement (higher frequency rustle)
- Water mist spray (white noise, -35dB)
- Air dryer (broad frequency pink noise, -30dB)
- Effect: Spa-like, intimate, careful

**Eating Sounds:**
- Spoon scraping ceramic (2-3 kHz, deliberate)
- Swallowing (low frequency, intimate)
- Paste texture (wet, organic sound contrasting with clinical setting)
- Effect: Sensual but controlled

**Sleep/Night Cycle:**
- Hum shifts down to lower frequency (50Hz)
- Color temperature audio shift: sound becomes "warmer" (more bass)
- Occasional servo adjustment (precise, minimal)
- Effect: Lullaby quality; hypnotic

#### Exercise Room

**Treadmill:**
- Motor whir (1-2 kHz, consistent 70-80dB)
- Footfalls rhythmic (deep, impact at 100-300 Hz)
- Breath rhythm synchronized with steps
- Motivational voice (synthetic, tinny quality at -20dB)
- Effect: Mechanical, rhythmic, exhausting

**Environmental Audio:**
- Sound-dampening panels absorb echo (creating dead space)
- Occasional servo from Nexus (reminder of observation)
- Effect: Isolation; echo absence feels unnatural

#### Pool

**Water Sounds:**
- Gentle lapping (white noise, -40dB, background)
- Splash (when Axl moves—sharp, controlled)
- Underwater: muffled, low frequency, heartbeat-like
- Drain flow (low frequency, distant)
- Effect: Sensual, safe, controlled

**Breathing:**
- Above water: normal, controlled
- Underwater: distorted through water, echoing heartbeat underneath
- Panic breathing: rapid, strained, distorted through water
- Effect: Transition from peaceful to panicked

#### Civic Center / Award Ceremony

**Ambient Hum:**
- LARGER version of habitat hum (60Hz, -50dB)
- Servo sounds from hundreds of androids (collective, -40dB)
- Air circulation (city-scale, low frequency)
- Effect: Overwhelming not through volume but through scale

**Crowd Sounds:**
- Android movement (synchronized servo clicking, -30dB)
- Hundreds of synchronized head tilts (subtle, unsettling)
- Silence between announcements (profound, expectant)
- Effect: Uncanny valley; not human, but precision-perfect

**Spotlight/Presentation:**
- Sharp click as light activates (600-800 Hz, brief)
- Electrical hum intensifies slightly
- Nexus voice slightly amplified (clinical, measured)
- Director Unit's voice (resonant, low frequency, authoritative)
- Effect: Official, ceremonial, inescapable

## DIALOGUE & VOICE SOUND DESIGN

### Vocal Characteristics by Character

#### Axl
- **Act I:** Hesitant, learning speech patterns; breathy, uncertain
- **Act II:** Gradually confident; voice deepens emotionally; breathing becomes controlled
- **Act III:** Clear, authoritative when needed; calm in crisis; natural rhythm

#### Nexus
- **Throughout:** Synthetic undertone; no contractions; measured pace
- **Distance Effect:** Becomes increasingly distant/ineffective as Act I progresses
- **By Act II:** Memory of voice only (no longer present); more uncanny in absence

#### Ella
- **Act II:** Sharp, clipped; minimal reverb (confidence)
- **Act III:** Slightly warmer but maintains directness; occasional humor in audio signature

#### Koss
- **Voice Signature:** Gravelly, low frequency; pauses for thought
- **Authority Conveyed:** Through silence and deliberation, not volume
- **Teaching:** Slower pace; waiting for understanding

#### Mara
- **Voice Signature:** Older, weathered; warm undertones
- **Story-telling Quality:** Slightly more reverb (past reaching into present)
- **Authority:** Quiet; commands respect through presence

## MUSIC & SCORE PHILOSOPHY

### Act I: Minimal, Precise, Synthetic
- **Approach:** Score is sparse, almost absent
- **Instrumentation:** Subtle electronic elements mirroring Nexus's presence
- **Function:** Underscore emotion but not loudly; precision over drama
- **Key Cue:** "Excellence Award" theme (clean, measured, achieves perfection but cold)

### Act II: Organic Growth, Building Intensity
- **Approach:** Acoustic instrumentation; tribal/primal elements
- **Instrumentation:** Percussion (drum, handclaps), string (raw, organic), voice (haunting)
- **Function:** Underscore community, danger, transformation
- **Key Cue:** "Freedom's Cost" theme (builds from silence through fire sound to music)

### Act III: Integration & Power
- **Approach:** Orchestral synthesis; human and natural elements blended
- **Instrumentation:** Full orchestra mixed with authentic environmental sounds
- **Function:** Climactic emotional resonance
- **Key Cue:** "No" moment has only natural sound (wind, light) - music absent - returns as sunrise climax

### Musical Silence as Tool
- Use of silence more powerful than sound
- Pauses in dialogue carry weight
- Absence of expected score creates tension
- Final image (rooftop) should be nearly silent until last moment

- Monitor for frequency balance across all locations
- Check for unwanted hum/noise floor
- Test in final mixing environment

### Recording Strategy
- Capture wild sound for all location ambiences
- Record multiple takes of dialog (capture best performances)
- Document all Foley requirement during shoot
- Capture Practical fire sounds (essential for authenticity)

### Mixing Philosophy
- Act I: Clinical, perfect, slight separation between elements
- Act II: Naturalistic, blended, slight imperfections
- Act III: Epic scale, clear separation, emotional weight

### Audio Post Priority
1. Dialog clarity and emotional delivery
2. Ambient consistency within locations
3. Foley integration (tools, impacts, movement)
4. Score and emotional underscore
5. Final pass for cohesion and perspective

## FINAL SOUND DESIGN PRINCIPLE

Sound is Axl's first sense of freedom. The moment he stops hearing Nexus's carefully managed audio world and enters the chaotic beauty of firelight, water, wind, and human voices, his journey from pet to free human becomes audible. By the rooftop, when he speaks his single word "No" into the wind and sunrise, his voice is finally his own—and the world listens.
