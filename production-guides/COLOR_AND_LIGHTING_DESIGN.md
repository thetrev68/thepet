# The Pet - Color Palette & Lighting Design

A comprehensive guide to color grading, lighting philosophy, and visual mood evolution throughout the screenplay.

---

## VISUAL PHILOSOPHY OVERVIEW

The primary visual language of **The Pet** is contrast between two worlds:

### The Android World
- **Color Palette:** Cool, desaturated, precise
- **Lighting:** Clinical, controlled, artificial; no shadows except those created by design
- **Texture:** Smooth, reflective, seamless
- **Quality:** Clarity above all; perfect focus, perfect exposure
- **Emotional Tone:** Order, safety, sterility, control

### The Human/Stray World
- **Color Palette:** Warm, saturated, organic
- **Lighting:** Natural, harsh, chaotic; deep shadows and bright highlights
- **Texture:** Rough, matte, weathered
- **Quality:** Imperfect; depth of field limited by available light; grain and noise acceptable
- **Emotional Tone:** Life, struggle, authenticity, freedom

### The Transition
- **Progression:** From cool to warm; from artificial to natural; from ordered to chaotic
- **Gradient:** Not sudden; scenes gradually shift as Axl's consciousness shifts
- **Metaphor:** Color temperature as temperature of soul (frozen → warm)

## ACT I: DOMESTICATION (Cool/Sterile/Blue-White)

### Base Palette
| Element | Hex | RGB | Purpose |
|---------|-----|-----|---------|
| Primary White | #FFFFFF | 255, 255, 255 | Seamless walls, clinical purity |
| Cool Gray | #E8E8E8 | 232, 232, 232 | Secondary surfaces, non-jarring transitions |
| Accent Gray | #B0B0B0 | 176, 176, 176 | Detail, depth without darkness |
| Chrome/Metal | #C0C0C0 | 192, 192, 192 | Nexus body, surfaces, tech elements |
| Cool Blue (accent) | #E0F4FF | 224, 244, 255 | Lighting, glow, tech interfaces |
| Deep Blue (accent) | #4A7BA7 | 74, 123, 167 | Night cycle, depth, pools |

### Lighting Scheme: Habitat & Related Spaces

**Color Temperature:** 5000-6500K (cool daylight)
- Slightly blue-shifted to feel clinical and artificial
- Perfect for high-efficiency LED lighting

**Intensity:** Bright without harshness
- Illuminance: 500-1000 lux (office-level brightness)
- No natural shadows; only architectural shadows created by curved walls
- Absence of shadows creates uncanny, flattened space

**Direction:** Diffuse, from above and integrated into structure
- Ceiling is the light source (integrated panels)
- Wall light (sconces, integrated panels) for secondary illumination
- No practical light sources visible (no lamps, bulbs, or fire)
- Shadows minimal; what shadows exist are soft and designed

**Night Cycle Lighting:**
- Shifts to 3000K (warmer, but still artificial)
- Reduces illumination to 100-200 lux
- Color shifts toward deep blue (#4A7BA7) with slight purple undertone
- Still perfectly controlled; no randomness
- Creates sense of artificial lullaby

### Scene-Specific Lighting

**Scene 1-1 (Morning Routine):**
- Color temp: 6500K (cool morning light)
- Illuminance: 800 lux
- Xcolor: Skylight-equivalent blue cast
- Effect: Awakening in a perfect world; no shadows

**Scene 1-2 (Exercise Room):**
- Color temp: 6500K consistent
- Illuminance: 1000+ lux (optimal for performance)
- Effect: Hyper-lit, energizing; almost sterile clarity

**Scene 1-3 (Swimming Pool):**
- Primary light: Reflected from water (blue-white)
- Secondary light: Overhead (5500K)
- Water color: Perfect cyan-blue (almost unnatural purity)
- Caustics: Subtle, suggesting underwater light refraction
- Effect: Beautiful but artificial; uncanny perfection

**Scene 1-4 (Bathroom):**
- Color temp: 5500K (neutral, clinical)
- Illuminance: 800 lux (medical-facility level)
- Mist lighting: Slight blue-white glow
- Effect: Sensory deprivation chamber; warmth through mist but no real heat

**Scene 1-5 (Evening):**
- Color temp: 3500K (artificial sunset)
- Illuminance: 300-500 lux (golden hour aesthetic, but controlled)
- Color: Warm gold/amber (#FFD700 to #FFA500) mixed with underlying blue
- Effect: Beautiful prison; warmth that's engineered, not natural

**Scene 1-6 (Transport Pod):**
- Exterior: 6500K (daylight)
- Interior pod: 5500K (neutral, slightly cool)
- Window: Reflections of passing city (high-contrast, geometric)
- Effect: Transition space; between environments

**Scene 1-7 (Park Activities):**
- Color temp: 6000K (optimized daylight)
- Illuminance: 600 lux (bright enough to prevent shadows)
- Artificial grass: Muted green (#7CB342, desaturated)
- Play structures: Muted blues and grays (no primary colors)
- Effect: Safe, engineered "nature"; nothing actually natural

**Scene 1-8 (Ella's Arrival):**
- Base: 6000K (park standard)
- Enforcers' energy poles: Electric blue glow (#00BFFF)
- Ella's clothes: Brown and gray rags (stands out as "wrong")
- Crate: Pure white (#FFFFFF) - sterile containment
- Effect: Color intrusion; Ella's warmth-toned rags contrast with cool surroundings

**Scene 1-11 (Civic Center):**
- Color temp: 6500K (coolest, most clinical)
- Illuminance: 1200+ lux (overwhelming brightness)
- Surfaces: Chrome and dark glass, high contrast
- Directory/tech interfaces: Bright blue (#1E90FF) and cold white
- Effect: Visual overwhelm; scale through brightness

**Scene 1-12 (Award Ceremony):**
- Base: 6500K
- Spotlight: Extremely bright white (8000+ lux in isolated circle), creating harsh shadows outside
- Director Unit: Backlit, silhouetted against tech glow (#00BFFF and #1E90FF)
- Effect: Interrogation lighting; Axl isolated and exposed

**Scene 1-13-1-17 (Progression scenes):**
- Slow shift toward slightly warmer tones (4000-5000K)
- Introduction of subtle color in background (faint suggestions of color beyond the habitat)
- Increasing sense of confinement despite the bright lighting
- Effect: Familiarity becoming claustrophobic

### Key Lighting Principles for Act I

1. **No Practical Light Sources:** Every light is architectural/integrated. This creates uncanny perfection.
2. **Minimal Shadow:** The absence of shadow is unnatural; it's the key to the habitat's alienness.
3. **Color Consistency:** Every space follows the same temperature logic; this consistency IS the control.
4. **Diffuse Quality:** Soft light that seems to come from nowhere specific; creates sense of constant observation.
5. **High Brightness:** Makes the space feel open despite being enclosed; eye cannot adjust for comfort.

## ACT II: ESCAPE & FREEDOM (Warm/Natural/Fire)

### Base Palette Shift
| Element | Hex | RGB | Purpose |
|---------|-----|-----|---------|
| Black (true) | #000000 | 0, 0, 0 | Shadow depth; real darkness for first time |
| Dark Gray | #333333 | 51, 51, 51 | Tunnel walls, concrete |
| Rust/Orange | #B8860B | 184, 86, 11 | Fire, oxidized metal, aged surfaces |
| Earth Brown | #8B7355 | 139, 115, 85 | Soil, salvaged materials, clothing |
| Fire Orange | #FF6347 | 255, 99, 71 | Flames, direct light source |
| Deep Red | #8B0000 | 139, 0, 0 | Embers, danger, blood |
| Moss Green | #8FBC8F | 143, 188, 143 | Vegetation, life returning |

### Lighting Scheme: Tunnel Network

**Color Temperature:** 2700-3500K (warm, fire-based, with cooler ambient from distance)
- Fire = primary color source (shifts 2000-2700K at core)
- Ambient = distant tunnel light, cooler (4000-5000K at periphery)
- Creates natural color gradients

**Intensity:** Dramatically lower than Act I
- Illuminance: 50-200 lux (firelight levels)
- Human eye must adapt; shadows everywhere
- High contrast between lit and unlit areas

**Direction:** Point source (fire) + ambient reflection
- Fire is THE light; it controls the scene
- Light falls off dramatically with distance
- Shadows are deep, permanent, defining

**Natural Light Transitions:**
- Scenes at entrance/descent: Incorporate remaining daylight (6000K)
- As depth increases: Light becomes exclusively fire-based (2700K)

### Scene-Specific Lighting

**Scene 2-1 (Habitat Escape):**
- Color temp: Shifts from 6500K (habitat) to 5000K (catwalk exterior)
- Illuminance: Remains bright (500+ lux on city)
- Effect: Harsh exterior light feels cold despite being warmer than habitat

**Scene 2-2 (Catwalk Escape):**
- Color temp: 5500K (harsh daylight at height)
- Illuminance: Very bright (800+ lux)
- Sky: Cool blue (#87CEEB)
- City below: Geometric play of light and shadow
- Effect: Exposed, vulnerable; nowhere to hide

**Scene 2-3 (City Chase):**
- Color temp: 5500K (artificial light from city infrastructure)
- Illuminance: Mixed; 200-600 lux depending on proximity to light sources
- Service corridors: Harsh, industrial lighting (#FFFFFF and #E0E0E0)
- Effect: Still artificial but becoming more chaotic

**Scene 2-4 (Meeting Ella):**
- Color temp: 4500K (abandoned sector, mixed light)
- Illuminance: 100-300 lux (dusk/dim conditions)
- Shadows: Deep, concealing
- Ella's clothing: Browns and earth tones now blend rather than stand out
- Effect: Transition into stray world; darkness now conceals rather than threatens

**Scene 2-5 (Tunnel Descent):**
- Color temp: Gradual shift from 5000K to 3500K as they descend
- Illuminance: Drops from 300 lux (near entrance) to 50 lux (deep tunnel)
- Remaining sunlight: Skylight blue (#87CEEB) fading to absence
- Effect: Literal descent from one world to another

**Scene 2-6 (First Nest):**
- Color temp: 2700K-3000K (firelight)
- Illuminance: 80-150 lux (fire-dependent)
- Fire color: Orange to deep red (#FF6347 core, #8B0000 embers)
- Walls: Illuminated in orange; shadows behind characters
- Effect: Warmth for first time; also danger and primitive power

**Scene 2-7 (Water Source):**
- Color temp: 4000K (natural light from shafts + reflected from water)
- Illuminance: 200-400 lux (concentrated sunlight through gaps)
- Water: Reflects sky, appearing pure blue (#87CEEB) and clear

- Effect: Beauty of natural world; contrast with urban and fire-lit scenes

**Scene 2-8 (Identity Change - Burning Tunic):**
- Color temp: 2700K (firelight intense)
- Illuminance: Fire becomes brighter (150-200 lux) as tunic burns
- Tunic burning: Bright orange flame consuming white fabric
- Effect: Visually, old identity being consumed by new world's fire

**Scene 2-9 (Foraging Lesson):**
- Color temp: 4500K (daylight in overgrown ruins)
- Illuminance: 300-500 lux (good natural light, dappled by vegetation)
- Color: Moss greens (#7CB342, #8FBC8F), browns, rust (#B8860B)
- Effect: Nature reclaiming the world; beauty in decay

**Scene 2-10 (Evening Gathering):**
- Color temp: 2700K (firelight)
- Illuminance: 100-150 lux (warm and intimate)
- Faces illuminated in orange and shadow
- Spear: Catches firelight, becomes symbol
- Effect: Community warmth; belonging

**Scene 2-12 (Market Tunnel - Enforcer Encounter):**
- Color temp: 4000K (daylight in abandoned space)
- Illuminance: Drops to 50-100 lux (deep interior, limited light)
- Enforcer lights: Blue-white (#00BFFF) - intrusion of android world into human space
- Effect: Conflict between worlds rendered in light

### Key Lighting Principles for Act II

1. **Fire as Character:** The fire is not just a light source; it's a living presence. Flickering creates dynamic, imperfect lighting.
2. **Shadows as Safety:** Darkness now conceals rather than threatens. Shadows are where humans hide.
3. **Natural Variation:** Unlike Act I's perfect consistency, Act II lighting changes moment to moment.
4. **Color Temperature Gradients:** Light transitions show Axl's journey. Cool → warm → cool again during chase → warm at nest.
5. **Low Illuminance:** Forces intimacy; creates sense of limited world (the light only extends so far).

  - Eyes: Catching the light directly; clarity visible
  - Background: City no longer oppressive; just an object

**Scene 3-5 (Epilogue - New Nest):**
- Color temp: 4500K (natural daytime in tunnels; light from entrance visible)
- Illuminance: 150-300 lux (natural light penetrating deeper than before, suggesting integration)
- Faces: Still fire-lit in intimate moments, but background shows daylight influence
- Effect: World is opening; still tunnels, but light is entering

### Key Lighting Principles for Act III

1. **Light as Weapon:** During battle, light is chaotic and used as visual equivalent of sound design.
2. **Natural Light Triumph:** By rooftop, Axl is lit by actual sun for (possibly) the first time with full consciousness.
3. **Scale Through Light:** Wide shots use light to reveal space; narrow shots use light to isolate characters.
4. **Color = Emotion:** Gold light = hope; cool light = freedom; darkness = struggle; blue light = vast sky
5. **Transition:** From fire-dependent to sun-dependent; mirroring Axl's transition from one world to another.

## CINEMATOGRAPHY & COLOR GRADING NOTES

### Overall Color Correction Strategy

**Act I:**
- Lift blacks slightly (darkness avoided)
- Crush shadows minimally (maintain detail)
- Shift whites toward cool blue (+500K cooler than neutral)
- Saturation: Reduce slightly; world feels desaturated
- Contrast: Moderate; no harsh blacks

**Act II:**
- Lift blacks (shadow detail preserved)
- Crush shadows to define form (separation from background)
- Warm shadows (brown/orange undertones)
- Saturate reds, oranges, earth tones
- Increase contrast moderately (firelight creates definition)

**Act III:**
- Lift blacks in tunnel scenes; crush in battle scenes
- Warm shadows (transition light)
- Saturate in preparation/epilogue; desaturate in battle (bleached)
- Increase contrast significantly (light/dark clearly separated)

### LUT (Look-Up Table) Recommendations

- **Act I:** Cool, desaturated LUT (think Apple commercial or luxury tech brand)
- **Act II:** Warm, saturated LUT (think survival/adventure film)
- **Act III Battle:** High-contrast, slightly bleached LUT (visual violence through light)
- **Act III Rooftop:** Golden hour LUT, warm and hopeful

### Lighting Ratio Strategy

| Scene Type | Lighting Ratio | Effect |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| Act I conversations | 2:1 to 3:1 (minimal shadows) | Clinical, exposed |
| Act I intimate (grooming) | 2:1 (flat, safe) | Vulnerable |
| Act II tent/dialogue | 4:1 to 5:1 (deep shadows) | Intimate, secure |
| Act II travel | 8:1 to 10:1 (extreme contrast) | Danger, exposure |
| Act III battle | 15:1+ (crushed blacks) | Chaos, extremity |
| Act III rooftop | 3:1 (balanced, clear) | Peace, clarity |

## PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE FOR CINEMATOGRAPHER

### Key Lighting Goals by Scene

**Habitat Scenes:** Recreate clinical perfection
- Use soft boxes, LED panels
- Eliminate shadows or create soft, designed shadows
- Maintain cool color temperature rigidly
- High illuminance; eye should not adapt

**Tunnel Scenes:** Recreate firelight realism
- Practical fire element OR LED firelight simulation
- Use directional lighting to create dramatic shadows
- Natural color variation (warm/cool pockets)
- Low illuminance; eye constantly adapting

**Transition Scenes:** Create visual bridge
- Use color temperature gels to shift light
- Move from diffuse to directional
- Introduce shadows gradually
- Allow visual adaptation to play role

**Battle Scenes:** Create chaos through light
- Multiple contradictory light sources
- Flash impacts from practical effects
- High contrast; crushed blacks
- Movement-based lighting (strobing, flashing)

## FINAL COLOR PHILOSOPHY

The journey from Act I to Act III is a journey from artificial to natural, from controlled to wild, from cool to warm. Every color choice should reinforce this trajectory. The world literally warms up as Axl's consciousness expands. By the rooftop, he stands in the light of the actual sun—the ultimate validation that authentic light exists, that his journey is real, and that the android world's artificial light was always a lie.
