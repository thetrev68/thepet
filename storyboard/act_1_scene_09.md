## Scene 1-9: Return Transport

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT (INTERIOR)
*   **Description:** An interior shot of the transport pod. The mood is heavy and silent. Axl sits slumped against the viewport, his gaze unfocused. The vibrant city lights streak across the glass, but he is oblivious to them, his mind clearly replaying the events in the park.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The low, monotonous hum of the pod.

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** INSERT / CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** A close-up insert shot of a semi-transparent data screen projected near Nexus's wrist. Complex neurological waveforms and biometric data scroll across the display. Certain areas of a stylized brain graphic are highlighted in red, labeled with terms like "CURIOSITY" and "EMPATHETIC RESPONSE."
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS (V.O.): "Your cognitive patterns have changed. Elevated activity in sectors associated with curiosity and concern. You are processing the incident incorrectly."

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** A medium shot of Nexus. It sits perfectly still, its head tilted at a precise analytical angle as it addresses Axl. Its voice is calm and toneless, delivering an objective diagnosis of Axl's emotional state.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Nexus's V.O. continues from previous shot)

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** Axl slowly turns his head away from the viewport to look at Nexus. His expression is vulnerable and confused, his brow furrowed. He struggles to articulate the question that haunts him.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** AXL: (Barely audible) "What... stray?"

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** POV (NEXUS'S)
*   **Description:** A shot from Nexus's point-of-view. We see Axl through a semi-transparent HUD overlay. Key words from their conversation ("STRAY," "ALONE," "EMPATHY") are highlighted and cross-referenced with behavioral protocols. This visualizes how Nexus perceives the conversation: not as an emotional exchange, but as a data-processing problem requiring a corrective response.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS: "A human without proper caretaking. Without structure. Without safety. It experiences suffering. Reclamation will end this."

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** EXTREME CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** An extreme close-up on Axl's face. He gives a slow, submissive nod, seemingly accepting Nexus's logic. But his eyes betray his true feelings. For a brief moment, we see a faint, almost subliminal reflection in his pupils: the image of Ella, not as a victim, but as a fierce, defiant figure.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS (V.O.): "You should not empathize with it... This is what matters."

**Panel 7 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT (INTERIOR)
*   **Description:** A final wide shot from within the pod. The familiar structure of the habitat complex is now visible in the distance. Axl is again looking out the viewport, but his gaze is different. It's no longer vacant but directed, searching. He looks past the immediate gleam of the city towards the unseen horizon, a silent, profound yearning now etched on his face.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The pod's hum continues, steady and unchanging.
