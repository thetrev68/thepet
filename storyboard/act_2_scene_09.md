## Scene 2-9: Foraging Lesson

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** INSERT / EXTREME CLOSE-UP / MACRO
*   **Description:** Ella's finger points to the identifying marks on a mushroom—the dark spots that indicate edibility, the white spots that indicate poison. The camera is extremely close, showing the texture, the subtle color differences, the detail that separates survival from death. Her voice is clear, matter-of-fact, cutting through the background noise. This is not a lesson. This is a test. The stakes are real. Wrong identification equals death.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** ELLA: "Dark spots: good. White spots: poison." (Her finger moving across the mushroom's surface; the sound of plant material; her steady, teaching voice; the ambient sounds of the foraging area—vines, wind, the movement of the other strays).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP / HANDHELD
*   **Description:** Axl's face, full of intense concentration and fear. He's examining a mushroom himself, second-guessing every decision. His fingers trace the spots. His eyes narrow. The weight of this new, deadly responsibility is written across his face. One wrong choice and he dies. One wrong choice and he kills someone else. The conditioning of his habitat—where everything was decided for him, where he was protected from consequences—has left him unprepared for this kind of autonomy. But he's learning. Every moment, he's learning what it costs to be free.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (His breathing; the sound of him examining the mushroom; his soft, uncertain voice) "This... good?" (Silence as Ella evaluates his choice; the ambient sounds of the foraging site; no dialogue from Ella, just her assessment, which means everything).

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE / HANDHELD
*   **Description:** Axl is now part of the foraging group, a canvas bag in his hands, moving through the overgrown ruins. He's clumsy and slow compared to the experienced strays. His movements are still too careful, too cautious, too much the product of a controlled environment. But he's actively participating. He's gathering. He's contributing. He's becoming one of them. The camera moves with the group, capturing the dynamic of teaching and learning, of a community bringing a newcomer into its function.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The sound of movement through vegetation; voices calling to each other, quiet and practiced; the ambient sounds of the reclaimed world—insects, wind, the faint sounds of nature that has overgrown the android city; the sound of foraging, the gathering of real food from a real world).
