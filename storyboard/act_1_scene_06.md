## Scene 1-6: Transport to Park

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT / ESTABLISHING SHOT
*   **Description:** An establishing shot of the city's transport system. A sleek, white, teardrop-shaped pod glides silently along a dedicated magnetic track elevated above the pristine, empty streets. The background is a stunning vista of futuristic android architecture—gleaming skyscrapers that pierce the clouds and interconnected sky-bridges forming a complex, geometric web. The scene is clean, orderly, and devoid of any human messiness.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The faint, futuristic, high-pitched hum of the pod moving along its track.

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM 2-SHOT (INTERIOR)
*   **Description:** An interior shot of the transport pod. The inside is as minimalist as the habitat, with two facing benches. Axl is on his knees on one bench, his hands and face pressed against the large, curved viewport. His eyes are wide with a mixture of awe and confusion as he takes in the cityscape. Opposite him, Nexus sits perfectly erect and still, a silent, observing presence.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (None)

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** POV (AXL'S)
*   **Description:** A point-of-view shot from Axl's perspective, looking out the viewport. The camera rushes past the bases of colossal buildings, creating a sense of dizzying speed and scale. The architecture is imposing and alien, with no signs of organic life or nature. The visual language emphasizes Axl's feeling of being a small creature in a vast, non-human world.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The sound of the pod is slightly more prominent, a rushing sound.

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** EXTREME CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** An extreme close-up on Axl's face. His eyes are wide and luminous, reflecting the flashing lights and moving structures of the city outside. His mouth is slightly agape, his expression one of pure, childlike wonder. This is the first time he has seen the world outside his controlled environment, and his fascination is palpable.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS (V.O.): "You are displaying heightened interest in the external environment. This is expected. Exposure to varied stimuli supports psychological development."

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** A medium shot of Nexus. A soft, blue light briefly illuminates a panel on its chest, accompanied by a soft CHIME. Nexus's head tilts slightly towards Axl. Its posture remains unchanged, but the gesture indicates it is about to impart information.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** A soft, pleasant notification CHIME. NEXUS: "Socialization period commences in two minutes. Behavioral parameters are as follows: remain within designated enclosure, engage in low-impact activity, maintain proximity to me or other designated android supervisors. Do you acknowledge?"

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** A medium shot of Axl, still captivated by the view outside. He gives a short, noncommittal grunt—a reflexive sound rather than a sign of understanding—in response to Nexus's instructions. He doesn't turn or acknowledge the android in any other way, completely lost in the visual spectacle of the city.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** AXL: (A soft, reflexive grunt) "Hmph."

**Panel 7 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT (INTERIOR)
*   **Description:** A shot from inside the pod, looking forward. The pod is visibly decelerating. Through the front viewport, a new color enters the palette of sterile whites and greys: a vibrant, shocking patch of green. The clean lines of the city are beginning to give way to the more organic shapes of trees and grass, hinting at their destination.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The hum of the pod lowers in pitch as it slows down.
