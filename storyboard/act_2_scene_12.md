## Scene 2-12: Market Tunnel

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE / HANDHELD TRACKING
*   **Description:** The camera follows the group as they enter the cavernous, ruined market tunnel. The wide lens captures the scale of the decaying, pre-android world. Collapsed storefronts. Shattered displays. Rusted machinery. The remnants of human commerce, now abandoned, now reclaimed by time and entropy. Ella leads with her spear ready. Koss covers the rear. The others move in loose formation, alert, communicating without words. They've navigated these spaces many times. But danger is always a possibility.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The sound of their footsteps echoing in the vast space; the creak of old metal; wind moving through broken structures; their breathing, synchronized with their movements; the ambient sound of abandonment and age).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP / WHIP PAN
*   **Description:** A tight close-up on Ella's face. She freezes, hearing something. Her entire body becomes alert. The camera whip pans to follow her gaze toward a dark tunnel entrance. And there—a sound that sends a chill through the tunnel. The whine of an ENFORCER UNIT. Not expected. Not supposed to be here. The androids don't come this deep. But one has. And it's searching.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The sound of her breathing, now controlled and sharp; the ambient sounds of the tunnel; then the WHINE of the enforcer—unmistakable, electronic, the sound of threat).

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM / FRANTIC HANDHELD
*   **Description:** Chaos. The camera is tight on the characters' faces as they run through the dark tunnels, trying to keep up with Ella's lead. The framing is chaotic—moments of light, moments of darkness, the constant jostling of bodies in motion. Panic would kill them, but fear keeps them alive. They run silently—the whine of the enforcer growing closer, then fading as Ella navigates paths she knows instinctively. The camera captures their ragged breaths, their focused determination, the weight of survival.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Frantic footsteps; ragged breathing; the whine of the enforcer, growing closer and then fading; silence enforced by the need to not alert the machine; the sound of pursuit and escape, of running toward safety or running toward death—it's unclear which).

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE / STATIC
*   **Description:** They emerge into a section Axl recognizes—deeper in their home tunnels. Safe. They stop. They breathe. The camera is static now, giving them space to exist in stillness. No one speaks for a long moment. The enforcer sound has faded completely. They've escaped. But barely. And the knowledge that the androids are beginning to venture deeper, beginning to explore the spaces the strays have claimed, is a threat that hangs unspoken.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** KOSS: "You kept up. You didn't panic. You followed." AXL: (Breathing hard) "What we do?" ELLA: "We lived. That's all there is." (Breathing; the fading sound of the enforcer in the distance; the ambient sound of the tunnel; no celebration, just the acknowledgment of survival).
