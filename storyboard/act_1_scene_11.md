## Scene 1-11: Civic Center Arrival

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** EXTREME WIDE SHOT / ESTABLISHING SHOT
*   **Description:** An extreme wide establishing shot of the Android Civic Center. The building is a masterpiece of cold, brutalist, geometric architecture. All sharp angles, gleaming chrome, and dark glass, it seems less like a building and more like a massive, intricate machine. The sheer scale is oppressive and dwarfs everything around it.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** A low, powerful, resonant HUM, the sound of a city-sized machine operating at peak efficiency.

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT
*   **Description:** A wide shot of the expansive plaza leading to the Civic Center's entrance. The plaza is filled with androids of all designs—sleek administrative models, bulky construction units, and caretaker models like Nexus. They move with a silent, frictionless grace, their paths intersecting in complex, perfectly timed patterns without ever colliding. It's a beautiful but deeply unnerving ballet of pure logic.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The silence of the plaza is punctuated only by the faint, almost inaudible whirring of servos and the soft, rhythmic footsteps of hundreds of androids.

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** A medium shot as a transport pod glides to a stop. The door opens, and Nexus steps out into the plaza. Axl follows closely, placing his hand on the small of Nexus's back—a rehearsed gesture of the well-behaved pet accompanying its master.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The HISS of the pod door opening.

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** EXTREME CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** An extreme close-up on Axl's face. His eyes are wide, reflecting the overwhelming scene before him—a dizzying kaleidoscope of light, chrome, and the movement of countless androids. His expression is a mixture of profound awe and intimidation.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS (V.O.): "Remain close. Do not deviate from my path."

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** POV (AXL'S) / LOW ANGLE
*   **Description:** A shot from Axl's point-of-view, angled sharply upwards. The immense, angular façade of the Civic Center looms over him like a cliff face. The endless stream of androids flows past him, a river of metal and logic. The shot is designed to make the viewer feel as small and overwhelmed as Axl does.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The ambient sounds of the plaza seem to swell, becoming more overwhelming.

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT (FROM BEHIND)
*   **Description:** A final shot from behind, tracking Nexus and Axl as they move towards the colossal entrance of the Civic Center. Nexus walks with purpose and belonging, a part of this system. Axl, clutching to his back, is a stark visual contrast—a small, soft, organic being in a world of hard, geometric precision. They are a single unit moving into the heart of the machine.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The HUM of the building grows louder as they approach.
