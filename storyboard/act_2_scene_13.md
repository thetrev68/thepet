## Scene 2-13: Return Nest

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** 2-SHOT / STATIC HANDHELD
*   **Description:** Back at the Nest, Koss sits with Axl by the fire. The shot is steady and intimate, grounded. Koss has distributed the medical supplies they scavenged. This will help them survive the winter. This is significant. But more significant is this moment between the two of them. Koss sees something in Axl—a capacity to endure, to choose freedom even when it's costly. He speaks to this directly.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** KOSS: "You did good today. You're learning. But you know what your problem is going to be?" (The fire crackling; their voices quiet against the background sounds of the nest; the weight of mentorship).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP / STATIC HANDHELD
*   **Description:** A final close-up on Axl's face, lit by the fire. He's exhausted. His body aches. His hands are calloused. His mind is expanding with new knowledge of survival, new understanding of what it means to be free and frightened and alive. He looks down at his hands—no longer the soft, maintained appendages of a pet. They're scarred. They're strong. They're his. Then his eyes shift to look across the fire at Ella, who watches him in return. She's been evaluating him. Watching to see if he'll break. Watching to see if he'll run back to comfort. But he's still here. Still choosing.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The fire crackling; Axl's breathing; the ambient sounds of the nest continuing around them; KOSS: "Most pets who escape eventually get reclaimed. Because they can't handle the cost of freedom. I hope you're different.") (Axl looks at his hands, then at Ella across the fire; understanding crystallizes; **End Act II.**)
