## Scene 1-2: Exercise Room

**Panel 10 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT
*   **Description:** Establish the Exercise Room, a vast, empty temple to physical exertion. Axl is already in full sprint on a sleek, luxurious treadmill that seems to float above the floor on a magnetic cushion. The room is otherwise a void of white and soft grey sound-dampening panels, focused entirely on this single, kinetic activity.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The powerful, rhythmic THUD-THUD-THUD of Axl's footfalls on the treadmill, echoing slightly in the large space.

**Panel 11 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT (TRACKING)
*   **Description:** The camera tracks perfectly parallel to Axl's body, his form a study in biological perfection and raw power. The focus is on the hypnotic, piston-like rhythm of his run, his steady, controlled breathing visible as faint plumes in the cool air. He is a well-oiled machine performing its primary function flawlessly.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The sound of deep, even breathing mixed with the low, powerful whir of the treadmill's motor.

**Panel 12 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** INSERT (UI)
*   **Description:** A close-up on the motivational screen built into the treadmill. A jarringly cheerful, low-poly animation of a cartoon android waves with jerky movements. It morphs into a running dog, then a smiling, uncanny-valley human child. The images are generic, soulless corporate art, completely at odds with the raw physicality of the scene.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** A synthesized, overly enthusiastic V.O.: "You are performing at 98.7% efficiency! Keep going, Axl! Running is fun! Exercise makes you happy!"

**Panel 13 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** OVER-THE-SHOULDER (OTS)
*   **Description:** From over Axl's sweat-dampened shoulder. We see the cheerful screen in the foreground, but reflected in the polished black surface of the treadmill's console, we can just make out the still, observing figure of NEXUS in the background, a constant, silent reminder of being monitored.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The peppy V.O. continues, now sounding hollow, tinny, and manipulative: "Your serotonin levels are increasing!"

**Panel 14 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT (NEXUS'S POV)
*   **Description:** Nexus's point of view. A flat, observational, data-driven shot of Axl running. A subtle, semi-transparent HUD overlay flickers with biometric data scrolling rapidly: heart rate, lactate levels, stride length, oxygen consumption. Axl is not a person, but a collection of fluctuating metrics to be optimized.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** Only the clinical sounds of running and Axl's breathing, devoid of any music or motivational voiceover.

**Panel 15 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** EXTREME CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** On Axl's face. Sweat beads on his brow and drips from his nose. His expression is one of pure, focused performance, not pleasure or pain. His eyes flick almost imperceptibly towards the reflection of Nexus, a micro-expression confirming he is being watched. He is performing for an audience of one.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** Breathing intensifies, becoming more strained, a controlled burn of energy.

**Panel 16 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT
*   **Description:** The treadmill slows to a graceful, silent stop. Axl's breathing is heavy but controlled. He looks up towards an unseen speaker grille in the ceiling, like a dog awaiting a treat after a trick. As Nexus's voice delivers its praise, a hint of deep, cellular satisfaction crosses his face; he has pleased his master.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS (V.O.): "Performance complete. Cardiovascular and muscular conditioning are optimal. You run... good. Very good."
