## Scene 2-4: Meeting Ella

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM / HANDHELD
*   **Description:** Axl stumbles into a narrow alley between ancient, crumbling structures. One building is pre-android, abandoned to decay. The alley offers shadows and concealment. He collapses behind a stack of rusted power cells, his entire body shaking. The handheld camera collapses with him, staying low to the ground, emphasizing his exhaustion, his pain, his vulnerability. He is bleeding. His tunic is torn. His feet are lacerated. He's terrified. But he's alive. The finality of that strikes him in the silence.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (His ragged breathing; the ambient sounds of the abandoned sector—wind, the creaking of old metal; distant city sounds; silence).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE / STATIC HANDHELD / SHALLOW FOCUS
*   **Description:** Axl is a crumpled figure in the foreground, breathing heavily, wounded. The background is deep shadow and decay—old metal, rust, the archaeology of the pre-android world. Then, in the blurred background, shapes begin to move. Silhouettes. More shadows shifting. Axl tenses. He is not alone. He has escaped one cage, only to wander into another kind of danger—one with teeth, one with hunger.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (His breathing slowing slightly; soft sounds of movement in the darkness; the ambient hum of his own fear).

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM / SLOW PUSH IN
*   **Description:** Ella emerges from the darkness. The camera slowly pushes in on her as she materializes. Lean. Wiry. Moving like predator. She's holding a piece of sharp scrap metal like a knife. Her eyes are intense and alive and dangerous. There's nothing domesticated about her. Nothing controlled. Everything about her is choice and power and the knowledge of how to survive in spaces the androids abandoned. The camera's slow push makes her inevitable, unstoppable, a force of nature.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The sound of her movement; a faint scrape of her weapon against stone; her breathing, steady and controlled).

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE / POV / SLOW PAN
*   **Description:** From Axl's low-angle POV, looking up from where he crouches, the camera does a slow, nervous pan. Revealing more shapes. More faces. A small pack of strays—five, maybe six—all moving with silent coordination. All surrounding him. All watching him with eyes that have learned to read weakness and opportunity. This is predation. This is survival. The pack has assessed him and found him alone, wounded, marked with the tunic of a pet. An easy kill. Or maybe... something else.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Soft scraping sounds; breathing; the ambient silence of the abandoned sector; no words, just presence).

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** OTS / OVER THE SHOULDER (AXL'S)
*   **Description:** From over Axl's shoulder, we see Ella studying him. Her face is a mask of calculation and curiosity. She sees his clean, pristine pet tunic—announcing him as someone from the android world. She sees his unscarred skin, unmarked by survival. She sees his terror. She doesn't lower her weapon, but the pace of her assessment shifts. He's not food. He's something else. Something unknown. Her expression works through predatory evaluation to something like... interest.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** ELLA: "What are you?" (Her voice is rough, unused to extended speech, but the words are clear and threaded with danger).

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP / STATIC HANDHELD
*   **Description:** An intimate, raw, tight shot on Axl's face. He's terrified. His jaw trembles. But something crystallizes in him—a moment of clarity. He raises his hands slowly, empty, non-threatening. It's a gesture he's never made before. Something primordial in him understands this language better than the trained speech of the habitat. And from his mouth comes the first word he has ever truly owned, wrested free from the conditioning of years.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** AXL: (A strangled whisper, raw and uncertain) "Help." (Just that single word, the most powerful word he's ever spoken because it's genuine, because it's his).

**Panel 7 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE / STATIC HANDHELD
*   **Description:** Ella lowers her weapon. The decision is made. She turns and begins walking deeper into the darkness, her silhouette disappearing into shadow. Axl scrambles to his feet. He looks back one final time at the distant city—the chrome towers, the lights, the perfect android world that has been his entire existence. Then he turns and follows Ella into the darkness. He has made his choice. He is no longer property. He is choosing.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** ELLA: "Come on." (Simple. Not a question. Not a negotiation. Just a fact). (Sounds of the pack moving; Axl scrambling to his feet; the distant city humming behind them; silence ahead).
