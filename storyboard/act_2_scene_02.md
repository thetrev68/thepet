## Scene 2-2: Catwalk Escape

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM / HANDHELD
*   **Description:** Axl tumbles onto a narrow maintenance catwalk, his momentum chaotic, his body struggling to find purchase on the thin metal grating. The handheld camera tumbles with him, steadying just as he does. Disorienting. Chaotic. He's never been outside the habitat. He's never experienced uncontrolled space. The catwalk stretches impossibly thin into a geometry of wind and exposure. Wind WHISTLES around him—the first wind he's ever felt.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Wind roaring around him; his breath coming in gasps; the catwalk rattling beneath his feet).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE / POV / SHAKY TILT DOWN
*   **Description:** **From Axl's perspective.** A shaky, nauseating tilt down. The camera does not move smoothly. It moves like a terrified human looking over the edge of a building. Hundreds of stories below: the city. Chrome towers. Impossible distances. Moving vehicles like insects. The scale is crushing. The vertigo is absolute. The city sprawls in all directions—a maze of surfaces and heights and terrible, beautiful emptiness. This is the world he's never seen.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Wind RUSHING; the sound of the vast, distant city; a faint electrical hum from the towers below; Axl's breath, sharp and terrified).

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** 2-SHOT / HANDHELD
*   **Description:** Nexus emerges onto the catwalk behind Axl, its form rigid and perfect against the chaotic sky. The android's voice is clinical, informative, the inflection of protocol. It issues threats with the same toneless precision it used to issue breakfast. Behind Axl is the only life he has known. Below is the entire world he is about to choose. He looks back at Nexus. At the platform. At the drop. The wind buffets him. He makes his choice.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS: "Pet! Return to habitat immediately! Lethal force enforcers are being dispatched!" (The voice is cold, informative, empty of concern).

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE / FROM BEHIND / HANDHELD TRACKING
*   **Description:** The camera follows closely behind Axl as he runs along the catwalk. His figure is small and vulnerable against the massive architecture of the city. The chrome towers loom above and around him, making him insignificant. The wind buffets him. The catwalk threatens to shake apart beneath his bare feet. He is free, but free is also exposed, alone, terrified. But he runs. Behind him, Nexus does not follow. The android's programming does not permit it to venture into unmapped, uncontrolled space.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Wind howling; footsteps on metal grating; distant sounds of the city; his breathing, ragged and desperate).
