## Scene 3-4: Rooftop Freedom

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE / LOW ANGLE / SLOW TILT UP
*   **Description:** From inside a dark ventilation shaft, the camera tilts up slowly. The survivors climb upward, their battered forms silhouetted against the slowly brightening dawn sky. Each step takes them higher, away from the tunnels, away from the machines, away from the world of captivity. The tilt is glacial, giving the moment weight, building toward something transcendent. The light grows. They are emerging.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The sound of climbing; footsteps on metal; heavy breathing; wind growing stronger; the gradual crescendo of light and sound).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** SWEEPING CRANE / EPIC
*   **Description:** **A major stylistic shift to epic beauty.** A massive, sweeping crane shot reveals the handful of survivors on the rooftop against the entire, breathtaking skyline of the android city at sunrise. The city is stunning—chrome towers catching the first light, the geometric perfection of the android world rendered in shades of gold and silver. But it no longer defines them. The survivors stand small against this vastness, and yet they are free. The music swells. The visual language shifts from desperate survival to transcendent liberation. They have prevailed not because they were stronger, but because they were free.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Music swelling; the sound of wind at height; the ambient sound of a city waking; no dialogue, just the sound of victory and freedom and the new day).

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP / SLOW PUSH IN
*   **Description:** A slow push in on Axl's face as he looks out over the city that no longer owns him. His expression is not triumphant. It's clear. Certain. He speaks a single word, and the word carries the weight of every moment from Act I to this moment: "No." Not angry. Not celebratory. Just a calm statement of fact. His final answer to the androids' control. His definitive rejection of the life that was designed for him. One word, perfect and defiant, spoken to the rising sun and the vast, indifferent city below. The camera continues to push in, his face filling the frame, until his eyes hold the reflection of the dawn.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** AXL: (A clear word, perfect and defiant) "No. Not anymore." (His voice steady, powerful, the voice of someone who has claimed autonomy; the wind; the sound of the city waking; the music reaching its apex).
