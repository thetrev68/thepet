## Scene 1-13: Zephyr's Failure

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** OVER-THE-SHOULDER
*   **Description:** A shot from over Axl's shoulder, looking across the vast chamber. He catches sight of Zephyr's pet. The small female pet is visibly trembling, cowering close to Zephyr's leg. The contrast between her fear and Axl's own proud composure is stark.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The ambient hum of the chamber).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT
*   **Description:** The spotlight swings across the room and lands on Zephyr and its pet. As the harsh light hits her, the female pet physically flinches and tries to hide behind Zephyr, who stands impassively.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** DIRECTOR UNIT 7 (V.O.): "Zephyr-5123. Present your unit."

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** A medium shot of Zephyr on the dais. Its posture is different from Nexus's—more relaxed, almost conversational. It addresses Director Unit 7 not as a subordinate, but as a peer engaged in a fascinating research project.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** ZEPHYR: "...This unit demonstrates signs of abstract thought and emotional complexity. I am documenting these anomalies..."

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** EXTREME CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** An extreme close-up on the face of Zephyr's pet. Her eyes are wide with terror, and a single tear traces a path down her cheek. Her small body is wracked with tremors. The shot is designed to elicit empathy, showing the real emotional cost of Zephyr's "research."
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (A soft, frightened whimper).

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT
*   **Description:** A wide shot of the dais. Director Unit 7 speaks, and its voice is flat, cold, and absolute. The holographic screen behind it flashes red with the word "FAILURE."
*   **Dialogue/FX:** DIRECTOR UNIT 7: "Emotional instability is not a research opportunity. It is a care failure. Your assignment will be reassessed. Return to queue."

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** As Director Unit 7 dismisses it, Zephyr turns. Its usually fluid, graceful movements have become tight and jerky. It is the android equivalent of a human storming off in a rage, a clear physical manifestation of its failure and humiliation.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The sharp, almost angry sound of Zephyr's metallic footsteps as it pivots).

**Panel 7 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** A close-up on Axl's face. He watches Zephyr's walk of shame, and a slow understanding dawns on him. He processes the judgment: Zephyr failed, therefore Nexus succeeded. A small, smug smile touches his lips.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (A faint, triumphant musical cue).

**Panel 8 (Shot 8)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM 2-SHOT
*   **Description:** A medium two-shot of Nexus and Axl. Axl stands a little taller now, his chest puffed out with pride. He glances up at Nexus with pure adoration. He has been validated. His perfect obedience and lack of complexity are virtues.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The triumphant musical cue swells slightly).
