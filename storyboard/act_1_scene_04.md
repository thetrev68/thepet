## Scene 1-4: Bathroom

**Panel 27 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** Nexus methodically cleans a still, passive Axl, who sits on a stool. It's like a piece of performance art about hygiene. A fine, warm mist is sprayed from wall nozzles, followed by gentle, low-frequency vibrations from the floor that shake the water from his hair and skin in shimmering droplets. Axl's eyes are closed, completely surrendered to the technological process.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The soft, atomized HISS of misting and a deep, soft, vibratory HUM that you feel more than hear.

**Panel 28 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** On Nexus's smooth, synthetic hands as they move carefully through Axl's wet hair, toweling it with an absorbent cloth. The movement is precise, calculated, yet perfectly mimics a tender, caring gesture. The fingers are both machine-like and impossibly gentle.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** Continued sounds of grooming, quiet and rhythmic. The soft rubbing of cloth.

**Panel 29 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** Axl opens his eyes and looks directly at Nexus, his expression showing a new, dawning awareness and vulnerability. He asks his question, the words fragile and uncertain in the quiet room, a seeking for reassurance he's never needed before.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** AXL: (Soft, uncertain, raspy) "Nesses... keep... me... safe?"

**Panel 30 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM 2-SHOT
*   **Description:** A balanced, clean two-shot. Nexus looks "down" at Axl, its head tilted in that specific, analytical way. Its posture is authoritative but not threatening. It delivers its line as a core programming truth, a statement of unshakeable fact. The framing shows them together, but Nexus is the clear, unwavering authority in the space.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS: "Yes. I keep you safe. Always. This... is my primary function."

**Panel 31 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT
*   **Description:** Nexus gestures, and Axl obediently stands on a circular platform. A warm, low-temperature dryer activates from below, enveloping him in a column of golden light and swirling warm air. Axl stands quietly, arms slightly out, bathed in the light, fully passive and cared for, like a religious icon being venerated.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The gentle, enveloping WHOOSH of a warm air dryer.
