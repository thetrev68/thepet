## Scene 2-6: First Nest

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE / FROM AXLS POV / SLOW PAN
*   **Description:** From Axl's perspective, the camera enters the vast, dark chamber of the subway tunnel system. A slow pan reveals the scene as he sees it: a central fire burning in a rusted barrel—the first real fire he's ever witnessed, flames dancing with colors the habitat never showed him. Beyond the fire, the overturned subway car, ancient and massive, transformed into shelter. Around it, makeshift structures built from salvage and survival knowledge. And then the people—no, the strays. Maybe twenty of them, all turning to look at the newcomer. All evaluating. All watching. The firelight illuminates weathered faces, scarred bodies, eyes that have learned the difference between hope and death.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The crackle and pop of the fire; wind moving through the tunnel; the ambient sounds of the nest—quiet conversations stopping, tools being set down, the sudden focus of twenty minds on one newcomer).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** MONTAGE / STATIC / EXTREME CLOSE-UPS
*   **Description:** A quick montage of close-up shots on the strays' faces. Each illuminated by flickering firelight. Each tells a story: MARA, ancient and strong, her face lined with years of survival. KOSS, middle-aged and scarred, his expression unreadable. A young female, DARA, her eyes sharp and assessing. Others—FINN, young and eager; unnamed strays with burns, missing teeth, the physical markers of lives lived outside the sterile world. The firelight dances across their features. They are human. They are alive. They are terrifying.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Silence. The fire crackling. Breathing. The weight of collective observation).

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** 3-SHOT / HANDHELD / TIGHT
*   **Description:** Koss steps forward and explains the rules of this new society. Ella stands nearby, close enough to vouch for Axl. The framing is tight, emphasizing the gravity of this moment. This is initiation. This is the moment when Axl is either accepted or rejected. Koss's words are simple, direct, non-negotiable. Protocol. Survival. Trust. Never betray the pack. Never steal. Never trust androids.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** KOSS: "We survive. Together. We don't betray each other. We don't steal from the pack. And we never, ever trust the androids." (His voice is measured, authoritative, the voice of someone who has already paid the price of breaking these rules).

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP / SLOW PUSH IN
*   **Description:** An extreme close-up on Axl's mouth as he hesitantly eats the "real food" for the first time—something raw, primitive, unprocessed. His expression shifts through disgust, uncertainty, and then something else. It's unfamiliar. Maybe terrible. But it's also *real*. There's life in it. The nutrients paste had none of this texture, this resistance, this sense of something that once lived. He chews slowly, processing the new sensation. Processing what it means that he can digest something the androids never engineered.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The sound of him chewing; others around the fire eating quietly; ELLA's voice, soft) "It won't poison you. It'll make you stronger." (The fire crackling; wind in the tunnel; the ambient sounds of community).

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE / STATIC
*   **Description:** A final wide shot of the Nest as Axl becomes part of it. He sits by the fire now, his wounds beginning to be tended, his fear beginning to settle into something like relief. Around him, the community has returned to its work. Mara teaches two younger strays how to work leather. Another group sorts through salvaged electronics. It's not chaos. It's a functioning society built from necessity and ingenuity. Axl looks across the fire at Ella, who meets his eyes. Not a smile. But something like approval. Something like welcome. The shot is dark, full of shadow and dancing firelight, but it feels warm. This is his new home.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (ELLA: "Welcome to the tunnels, Axl.") (The fire crackling; quiet conversations; the sound of tools being worked; wind in distant tunnels; the breath of the earth itself).
