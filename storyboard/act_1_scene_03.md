## Scene 1-3: Swimming

**Panel 17 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT
*   **Description:** An almost abstract shot of the pristine, sterile pool—an aquamarine jewel set in a field of seamless white tile. The water is impossibly clear, the black lane-lines at the bottom perfect and unforgiving. At the far edge, NEXUS stands, a still, chrome statue, its reflection shimmering on the undisturbed surface of the water.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The gentle, rhythmic lapping of water against the pool's overflow edge. A faint echo.

**Panel 18 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** HIGH ANGLE / TOP DOWN
*   **Description:** From directly above, the camera tracks Axl as he swims laps with powerful, practiced strokes. He is a dark, fluid shape moving through the rigid geometry of the pool. It is pure, mechanical routine, a line drawn and erased over and over with brutal efficiency.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The muffled, rhythmic churn of a swimmer cutting through water. SPLASH, GURGLE, SPLASH, GURGLE.

**Panel 19 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP (UNDERWATER)
*   **Description:** Underwater. On Axl's face as he glides, a stream of bubbles escaping his lips. His eyes glance towards the reflection of Nexus on the water's surface, then shift towards the forbidden, darker blue of the unmarked deep end. A spark of rebellion, a flicker of a decision, crosses his face. The sound is muted, internal, and intimate.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** Muted, distorted underwater sounds; the deep, resonant THUMP-THUMP of his own heartbeat.

**Panel 20 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT
*   **Description:** Axl breaks his pattern, his straight line curving away from the designated shallow zone towards the deep end. We hear Nexus's calm, commanding voice, not with alarm, but as a simple statement of protocol violation. Axl hesitates for a single beat, then defiantly keeps going.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS (V.O.): "Axl. Deviation detected. Return to designated pattern. The deep zone is not authorized."

**Panel 21 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT (UNDERWATER)
*   **Description:** Underwater again. Axl ducks under the surface, plunging into a world of serene, dreamlike silence. His dark hair floats around his head like a halo. Sunlight filters through the water from above, creating dancing, ethereal patterns (caustics) on his skin. It is a brief, beautiful moment of pure, defiant peace and freedom.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** Total, beautiful, enveloping silence. A single, high-pitched, peaceful TONE.

**Panel 22 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP (UNDERWATER, SHAKY CAM)
*   **Description:** Underwater, the camera now handheld and shaky. The mood shatters. Axl's feet reach for a bottom that isn't there. The exhilaration on his face flips instantly to raw, primal terror. His eyes go wide. The camera work becomes chaotic and disorienting as he begins to struggle, his graceful movements turning clumsy and desperate.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The muffled, panicked sound of struggle, of choked breaths turning into gurgles. The peaceful tone is replaced by a low, rising PANIC DRONE.

**Panel 23 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** MONTAGE
*   **Description:** A frantic, quick-cut sequence of disorienting, visceral shots: Axl's face gasping above water, mouth wide in a silent scream; thrashing limbs from below, kicking at nothing; churning water and exploding bubbles. This frenzy of survival is intercut with a single, chillingly STATIC WIDE SHOT of Nexus watching, impassive and unmoving, from the edge, its head tilted analytically.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** Sounds of violent splashing, gasping, choking, intercut with jarring moments of total, clinical silence from Nexus's perspective.

**Panel 24 (Shot 8)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT, WHIP PAN
*   **Description:** A figure, a silver torpedo of purpose, dives into the pool. A whip pan follows the massive splash as the sleek LIFEGUARD ANDROID efficiently cuts through the water, its movements precise and powerful, closing the distance to the struggling Axl with terrifying, non-human speed.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** A loud, sharp SPLASH, then the sound of powerful, efficient swimming, like a motorboat.

**Panel 25 (Shot 9)**
*   **Shot:** LOW ANGLE 2-SHOT
*   **Description:** From Axl's POV on the deck. He's on his hands and knees, coughing up water, shaking uncontrollably. Nexus kneels over him, an unusual, almost transgressive gesture for the android. It places a hand on his chest—a clinical assessment of his vitals, not a comforting gesture. The framing is both claustrophobic and strangely intimate. Water drips from Axl's hair onto Nexus's pristine shell.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** Violent, gut-wrenching coughing, gasping, sputtering sounds.

**Panel 26 (Shot 10)**
*   **Shot:** EXTREME CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** On Axl's face as he looks up at Nexus. His eyes are wide with a cocktail of terror, confusion, and a strange new dependency. He whispers the android's name, not as a word, but as a sound of pure, desperate need. This is a turning point in their relationship.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** AXL: (A raw, whispered, water-logged) "Nesses..."
