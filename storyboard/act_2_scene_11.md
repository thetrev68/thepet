## Scene 2-11: Scouting Prep

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM 2-SHOT / HANDHELD
*   **Description:** Koss sits with Axl by the fire, and the camera is steady and intimate. This is mentorship. Koss has already decided that Axl is worth teaching. He delivers his warning directly: Axl will want to go back. When the cold is severe enough, when hunger gnaws deeply enough, when pain becomes unbearable, the memory of comfort will return. The memory of the habitat. Of safety. Of Nexus's care. That's when Axl will face his real test. Not escape. Not survival. But the choice to stay free even when captivity seems easier.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** KOSS: "You know what your problem is going to be? You're going to want to go back. When it gets hard enough, when you're cold enough, hungry enough, hurting enough, you're going to think about your habitat. About Nexus. About comfort. Most pets who escape eventually get reclaimed. Because they can't handle the cost of freedom. I hope you're different." (The fire crackling; Koss's voice steady and certain; Axl listening, taking this into his bones).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE / MOVING HANDHELD
*   **Description:** The Nest is a hive of activity. The handheld camera moves through the space, capturing the purposeful energy of the strays preparing for the scavenging mission to the northern market tunnel. They're checking weapons. They're distributing supplies. They're reinforcing the bonds of the pack, reminding each other of protocol, of survival methodology. It's not frantic. It's practiced. It's the movement of people who have done this many times, who know the risk, who move forward anyway because the alternative is stagnation and eventual death.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Tools being prepared; voices calling instructions; the sound of the pack organizing itself; Ella's voice, giving direction; Koss's voice, confirming plans; the ambient sounds of community preparing for something significant).
