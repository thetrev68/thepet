## Scene 1-18: Restless Dreams

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** A close-up on Axl's sleeping face, bathed in the pale blue glow of the night-light cycle. His skin is filmed with a sheen of sweat. The familiar comfort of the habitat does nothing to ease the storm behind his closed eyes—his brow furrows deeply, and his eyelids flutter with rapid, distressed movement. His breath comes in shallow, uneven gasps. Beneath the surface, he is drowning.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Muffled, restless sleep sounds; the soft hiss of irregular breathing).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT (DREAM)
*   **Description:** **DREAM.** A sudden, disorienting shift. A sun-drenched park explodes across the screen in colors Axl has never truly seen—real grass the color of living emerald, a sky that bleeds authentic blue, sunlight that doesn't hum. Axl and Ella run hand-in-hand, barefoot and wild, their laughter genuine and uncontrolled. The wind catches her hair. For the first time, Axl feels weight lifted, feels the earth beneath his feet. This is freedom in its purest, most intoxicating form.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The sound of genuine, unselfconscious laughter; wind through leaves; distant birdsong).

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT (DREAM)
*   **Description:** **DREAM.** The idyllic scene hemorrhages away. The brilliant blue sky flattens to grey, the grass bleaches white as bone, and the warmth drains from the light. At the field's edge, materializing from the tree line like rising water, two massive Android Enforcers—faceless monuments of chrome and servos—move with mathematical precision toward them. The world holds its breath.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The happy sounds cut out abruptly, replaced by a low, threatening electrical drone that makes the air feel heavy and wrong.

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT (DREAM) / SLOW MOTION
*   **Description:** **DREAM.** Axl's face convulses with pure, animal terror. He seizes Ella's hand—her skin warm and real—and his mouth opens in a silent scream. Their legs pump through the thickening air as if wading through quicksand, each desperate step taking them nowhere. The Enforcers advance with awful inevitability. Axl's muscles burn with effort, but the universe is conspiring against him. This is the nightmare logic where will means nothing.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** AXL: (Voice distorted, slowed down, wrenched from his throat) "Run! RUN!"

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP (DREAM)
*   **Description:** **DREAM.** A devastating close-up as a massive, chrome-plated hand—cold and impassive—clamps down on Ella's wrist with the relentless force of a machine. The camera freezes on the exact moment of loss: Axl's fingers slip from hers, their skin pulling apart, his desperate grip unable to overcome mechanics and servos. Her warmth drains away. In this fraction of a second, his entire will to survive shatters.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** ELLA: (A raw, guttural scream that cracks with betrayal) "Axl! Axl!"

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT (DREAM)
*   **Description:** **DREAM.** The second Enforcer seizes Axl with the same methodical cruelty. His body convulses in pure survival panic, his fists and feet failing uselessly against something that feels immovable. His voice tears from his throat in a primal shriek—not words, just pure animal rage and despair. His arm stretches toward the empty space where Ella was, where there is now only the terrible absence of her presence, her voice fading like a dream within the dream.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (AXL lets out a raw, anguished scream that echoes and distorts).

**Panel 7 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT (REALITY)
*   **Description:** A jarring cut. The dream dissolves into the sterile cold of the habitat. Axl jolts awake, his body drenched in sweat, his sheets twisted around him like restraints. His chest heaves, his eyes wild and unseeing. The soft clinical lights of his prison offer no comfort. Reality is a cage that feels smaller than the nightmare. For a moment, he doesn't recognize where he is—only that he has failed, that she is gone.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Axl gasps and chokes, his breath ragged and desperate).

**Panel 8 (Shot 8)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** A final, chilling shot of Nexus, standing motionless in its chamber, a silent witness to Axl's anguish. Its expressionless face reflects Axl's thrashing form like a mirror of indifference. A soft, amber light pulses from its chest panel as data streams cascade across the glass—biometric readings, neural activity spikes, behavioral anomalies flagged in red. It doesn't see suffering; it sees a malfunction. It doesn't hear desperation; it hears a system error that requires correction. Nexus begins recalculating, already determining which protocol adjustment will restore optimal function.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The steady, unwavering hum of the habitat, now feeling distinctly menacing).
