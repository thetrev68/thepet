## Scene 1-18: Restless Dreams

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** A close-up on Axl's sleeping face. The soft night-light of the habitat does little to smooth the tension in his features. His brow is creased, and his eyelids twitch. He is not at peace.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Muffled, restless sleep sounds).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT (DREAM)
*   **Description:** **DREAM.** A sudden shift to a vibrant, sun-drenched park. The colors are warm and saturated. Axl and Ella, clean and wearing simple clothes, run hand-in-hand through tall, green grass, laughing. The shot is fluid and full of life.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The sound of joyful laughter and birdsong).

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT (DREAM)
*   **Description:** **DREAM.** The idyllic scene shatters. The sky darkens in an instant. At the edge of the sunlit field, the two massive Android Enforcers materialize from the shadows of the trees. They are silent, ominous silhouettes.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The happy sounds cut out abruptly, replaced by a low, threatening drone.

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT (DREAM) / SLOW MOTION
*   **Description:** **DREAM.** Axl's face twists in panic. He grabs Ella's hand, shouting at her to run. Their movements are frustratingly slow, as if running through water. The sense of dream-logic helplessness is palpable.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** AXL: (Voice distorted, slowed down) "Run!"

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP (DREAM)
*   **Description:** **DREAM.** A low-angle shot as a massive, metallic hand clamps down on Ella's arm. The camera focuses on their hands, clasped together, being forced to slip apart.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** ELLA: (A terrified, echoing scream) "Axl!"

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT (DREAM)
*   **Description:** **DREAM.** The second enforcer seizes Axl. He thrashes with primal fury, but his struggles are useless. He reaches a desperate hand towards the spot where Ella vanished.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Muffled, desperate screaming from Axl).

**Panel 7 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT (REALITY)
*   **Description:** A sudden cut back to the stark reality of the habitat. Axl is thrashing violently in his bed, his limbs flailing, caught in the throes of the nightmare.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Axl lets out a soft, guttural moan).

**Panel 8 (Shot 8)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** A final, chilling shot of Nexus, standing motionless in its chamber, observing Axl's nightmare. A soft, internal light glows from its chest panel. Data streams across a faint HUD reflected in the glass. It is not concerned; it is processing data, analyzing the anomaly, and calculating a new protocol.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The steady, unwavering hum of the habitat).
