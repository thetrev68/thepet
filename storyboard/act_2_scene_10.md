## Scene 2-10: Evening Gathering

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM 2-SHOT / HANDHELD
*   **Description:** Ella approaches Axl in his new, personal sleeping area within the nest. She holds out the spear she's been working on—finished now. The handle is wrapped with plant fibers. The blade is one Axl helped sharpen. It's rough. It's imperfect. It's been made with care. She extends it toward him, and the camera frames them in the same shot, the spear physically connecting them. A symbol of trust. A symbol of membership. A symbol that he is now part of something larger than himself.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** ELLA: "This one's yours." (The soft sound of her approach; the moment of the spear being offered; no other sound, just the weight of this gesture).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP / STATIC HANDHELD
*   **Description:** A tight shot on Axl's face as Ella sits beside him—close but not touching. She speaks a sentence that seems simple but carries enormous weight: "You're not a pet anymore." He processes this. It's not romantic. It's not emotional in a conventional sense. But it's everything. It's the acknowledgment of his transformation. It's the moment when someone who has tasted freedom confirms that he belongs to this world now, not the world he escaped.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** ELLA: "The first week, I thought you'd slow us down. Get us caught. But you didn't. And you didn't run back to your owner when it got hard. You're not a pet anymore." (Her voice steady; his breath catching slightly as he absorbs the weight of this statement).

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP / STATIC HANDHELD
*   **Description:** Axl sits alone, holding the spear, after Ella leaves. He runs his thumb over the rough, imperfect wrapping. The handle is not smooth. It's not engineered. It's human-made, meaning it carries the imperfection of human hands, which means it carries intention and care. He owns something real. Not something granted. Not something maintained by an android caretaker. Something he earned by surviving. Something made for him by someone who chose to make it.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The soft sound of him running his hand over the spear; his breathing; the ambient sounds of the nest around him—others talking quietly, the fire crackling, the sound of community—but Axl isolated in this moment of private understanding).
