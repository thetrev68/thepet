## Scene 3-1: Rising Threat

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE / SLOW PAN
*   **Description:** A slow pan across the Nest reveals how much time has passed. Weeks of integration. The space is more organized now—shelters improved, supplies better organized, the infrastructure of survival refined. Axl moves among the strays with ease, no longer the newcomer, fully integrated. The makeshift community has solidified. But the mood around the fire is different now. The laughter has faded. Tension hangs in the air like smoke.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The fire crackling; voices quiet and strained; wind moving through distant tunnels; the ambient sound of worry).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP / STATIC HANDHELD
*   **Description:** A tight, fire-lit shot on Koss's grim face. The firelight casts deep shadows across his weathered features, accentuating the worry etched into his expression. He delivers his assessment with the precision of someone who has survived long enough to recognize when survival is about to become impossible. The words fall like stones: "We're trapped." His voice carries the weight of certainty. This is not speculation. This is the endgame.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** KOSS: "They know we're here. They're narrowing the search perimeter. We've got maybe two weeks before they close in completely." (His voice steady but heavy with finality; the fire crackling; the ambient sounds of the nest freezing—people stopping their work).

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM / SLOW PUSH IN
*   **Description:** Ella stands, rising from her place by the fire into the light. The camera slowly pushes in on her face as she speaks her defiant declaration: "Then we fight." It's not a suggestion. It's not a hope. It's a fact spoken by someone who understands that the only alternative to fighting is slow, inevitable capture. The firelight illuminates her features—not young, not beautiful in a conventional sense, but radiating the kind of beauty that comes from absolute clarity of purpose.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** ELLA: "Then we fight." (The fire crackling; the sound of the words settling into the silence; the weight of this statement understood by everyone present).

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** MONTAGE / STATIC HANDHELD
*   **Description:** A quick montage of the strays' faces reacting to Ella's declaration. Each face tells a story. Mara's face shows fear—she's old, she's tired, she understands what fighting means. Maya's expression carries uncertainty—caught between the logic of the declaration and the impossibility of their odds. Then finally Axl's face: grim resolve. He's already accepted this. He's already made the choice. The montage captures the range of human response to an impossible decision, and the slow consolidation of will.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Silence as each face registers; the fire crackling; breathing; the ambient sounds of people processing the weight of what's being said).

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE / STATIC HANDHELD
*   **Description:** Koss rises, taking command. He stands at the center of the group, his presence immediately shifting the dynamic from despair to purpose. He lays out the plan with tactical precision—fortify the Nest, use the tunnels to their advantage, set traps, make the androids come to them on territory the machines don't understand. The strays have found their resolve. They have a strategy. Not hope, but strategy—which is stronger.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** KOSS: "If we're going to do this, we do it right. We use the tunnels. We use our knowledge of this space. We set traps. We make them come to us." (His voice taking on the authority of a leader; the strays listening with new focus; the ambient sound shifting from despair to preparation).

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** 2-SHOT / RACK FOCUS
*   **Description:** Ella in the foreground, looking back at Axl in the background. The camera rack focuses from her determined face to his. They are in this together. The unspoken understanding between them—forged through weeks of survival, through teaching and learning, through trust built in small moments—is complete. No words are needed. The visual language says everything: they are a unit. They are committed. They are ready.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (No dialogue; just the sound of the fire; their breathing synchronized; the understanding between them audible in the silence).
