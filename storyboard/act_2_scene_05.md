## Scene 2-5: Tunnel Descent

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE / LOW ANGLE
*   **Description:** The entrance to the ancient subway system is revealed as a black, gaping mouth in the earth—a threshold between worlds. Massive concrete steps descend into absolute darkness. Ella stands at the edge, a silhouette against the last of the dying city light. She is at home here. She is native to the darkness. Behind her, the surface world is still visible, still a choice. But she turns toward the darkness without hesitation.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Wind at the entrance; distant city sounds fading; the void below breathing silence back up).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM / FROM BEHIND / HANDHELD TILT DOWN
*   **Description:** The camera follows closely behind Axl as he descends the stairs after Ella. Each step takes him deeper. The handheld camera tilts down—following his descent, following the disappearance of light. The city light above fades to a sliver, then to nothing. The screen darkens from grey to blue-black to near-total darkness. Only faint silhouettes remain visible—Ella's figure ahead, Axl's own hands on the railing. Sound becomes the primary sense. The world narrows to breathing and footsteps and the infinite descent.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** ELLA: (Calling back, her voice echoing) "My name is Ella. I was born in the tunnels. I've never been a pet. I've never been domesticated." AXL: (Small, uncertain) "What... what that mean?" ELLA: "It means I'm free. You're about to find out if that's better or worse than captivity." (Footsteps echoing; breathing; the sound of descent; the city fading away above).
