## Scene 2-7: Water Source

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE / STATIC
*   **Description:** Koss and Axl emerge into a massive underground chamber where something impossible exists: natural, flowing water. Shafts of daylight penetrate from high above—real sunlight, not artificial light cycles—illuminating a beautiful, moving stream. Crystal clear. Alive. A secret oasis in the dead, mechanical world. It's a stark contrast to the sterile, chlorinated pool from Act I, where Axl's every movement was recorded and his every splash was monitored. Here, water is wild. Water is free. Water is something that moves according to its own nature, not according to android protocol.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The sound of water flowing; distant bird sounds echoing from the surface far above; soft sunlight filtering down; the ambient sound of natural, uncontrolled life).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** LOW ANGLE / CLOSE-UP / STATIC HANDHELD
*   **Description:** From just above the water's surface, Axl cups the cold, clear water in his hands and drinks. The water is not processed. It's not balanced to optimal hydration metrics. It's raw and cold and real. A moment of pure baptism. His face contracts slightly at the shock of the cold, then opens. His eyes close. For a moment, he's not a pet being rehabilitated. He's a human experiencing water as it exists in nature. It's sacred. It's terrifying. It's freedom.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The sound of water; Axl's breathing; the soft trickle of water flowing through his cupped hands; sunlight glinting on the surface; no dialogue, just the sound of physical existence).

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** 2-SHOT / STATIC HANDHELD
*   **Description:** Koss and Axl sit by the water's edge on smooth stones. The shot is calm, steady, intimate in a different way than the chaos of escape. Koss gestures to a long scar running down his leg—the physical evidence of breaking, of reclamation escaped, of freedom purchased at the cost of permanent injury. He tells his story quietly. How he was a pet. How they were going to reclaim him. How he broke and ran. How the break healed wrong. How he walks with a limp now, but he walks where he chooses. The water moves beside them, indifferent to human suffering or human choice. The world continues.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** KOSS: "I was like that once. I was a pet for ten years. Then I broke my leg, and they were going to reclaim me. So I ran. The break healed wrong. I walk with a limp now. But I walk where I choose, not where they command." (Water flowing; wind moving through the cavern; the sound of two humans sitting in a place that doesn't belong to androids).
