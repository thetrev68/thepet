## Scene 2-8: Identity Change

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP / TILT DOWN
*   **Description:** Axl holds his old pet tunic in his hands. The pristine white fabric, now stained with blood and dirt, looks alien to him. He's been wearing it for years—it's the uniform of his existence, the visible marker of his status, his function, his place in the hierarchy. He looks at it one final time, really looking, as if seeing it for the first time. He turns it over. Checks the seams. Remembers the feeling of Nexus's servos handling it during maintenance cycles. Then, with deliberation, he drops it into the fire. The camera tilts down with the tunic as it falls, watching it catch flame, watching it burn.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The soft movement of fabric; the moment of release; the tunic hitting the fire; the sharp sound of flame catching fabric; the crackle of burning synthetic material).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM / STATIC
*   **Description:** From across the fire, Ella watches Axl burn his past. The light of the flames illuminates her face. She watches without expression until the tunic is completely consumed. Then—a single, subtle nod of approval. He has passed a test. He is no longer performing compliance. He is not keeping one foot in the world he escaped. He is burning bridges. He is becoming something else.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The fire consuming the tunic; Ella's breathing, steady and controlled; the ambient sounds of the nest continuing around them; no dialogue, just the weight of this gesture understood between them).
