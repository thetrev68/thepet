# Act I - Storyboard

## Scene 1-1: Morning Routine

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** EXTREME WIDE SHOT / ESTABLISHING SHOT
*   **Description:** An impossibly sterile, hyper-minimalist room (THE HABITAT) is revealed, bathed in the sharp, clinical light of an artificial sun ceiling. The seamless, optically-white walls curve into the floor, creating an infinite, edgeless space. One entire wall is a massive, perfectly clear pane of transparent material, showing no seams or distortion. In the vast, empty center of the floor rests a low, memory-foam plinth bed, a perfect grey rectangle. A single figure, AXL, is barely discernible as a slight rise in the fabric. The visual language is one of oppressive, structured emptiness and clinical observation.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** A single, soft, melodic CHIME resonates, holds for a beat, and then fades into a profound, humming silence.

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** FULL SHOT, SLOW DOLLY IN
*   **Description:** Axl uncoils from the bed with a preternatural grace, not the groggy stretch of a human but the fluid, boneless movement of a predator awakening. He is lean, with the physique of a dancer or a greyhound—all long lines and defined, efficient muscle. The camera begins a slow, almost imperceptible dolly-in, its movement as clinical and detached as a microscope lens, observing a specimen with detached curiosity.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** A low, almost imperceptible ambient HUM begins, the sound of the habitat's life support.

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT (AXL'S POV)
*   **Description:** From Axl's perspective, looking through the transparent wall into the adjoining kitchen area, equally sterile. The android NEXUS, a figure of gleaming chrome and white ceramic plates, featureless from behind, moves with the unnerving, frictionless precision of a high-end machine. Its back is to us as it prepares a meal, its motions economical and perfectly calculated.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS (V.O.): "Good morning. Sleep was... optimal." (The voice is synthetic, calm, and states a data point, not an inquiry.)

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** INSERT / EXTREME CLOSE UP (ECU)
*   **Description:** A stark visual and textural contrast. The camera performs a slow, deliberate pan across a minimalist tray. We start on a bowl of dark, unappealing, utilitarian grey nutrient paste, its texture thick and unappetizing. We pan to a small, elegant glass container of clear, luminescent oil that steams with a faint, ethereal vapor. One is raw fuel, the other is a refined reward. The focus is tack sharp on the textures.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** Nexus's V.O. continues, toneless and informative: "Nutrient batch 7G is ready. Caloric and mineral content is nominal."

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM 2-SHOT
*   **Description:** A perfectly symmetrical and detached frame. Axl stands at the transparent wall, a warm, biological form against the cold, hard barrier. A small, seamless aperture irises open with a faint whir. Nexus's synthetic arm, a marvel of polished metallic engineering, reaches through holding a grooming brush with soft, natural-looking bristles. The interaction is impersonal, transactional, like a zookeeper tending to a prized exhibit.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS: "Present yourself."

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** On Axl's face, his eyes are closed. His expression is one of passive, learned acceptance, like a prized show animal being groomed. Yet, there's a subtle tension in his jaw, a micro-flicker of an eyelid, revealing a deep, conflicting storm of comfort and confinement raging just beneath the placid surface. The lighting is soft, but casts sharp, analytical shadows.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The soft, rhythmic, satisfying sound of bristles moving through thick hair.

**Panel 7 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** Axl sits on a low platform, scooping the nutrient paste into his mouth with his bare hands. The movements are brutally efficient but primal, a messy, animalistic act. Grey paste smears around his mouth, a jarring, chaotic element that serves as a stark, visceral contrast to the pristine, sterile environment surrounding him.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The rough, unpleasant, wet sound of hands scraping against the ceramic bowl and the thick sound of him eating.

**Panel 8 (Shot 8)**
*   **Shot:** TIGHT CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** The camera pushes in slowly, uncomfortably close on Axl's face. He is straining, his jaw working, trying to form words around the thick paste. The physical effort is immense, his frustration and the dawning realization of his own vocal limitations are palpable in the strained tendons of his neck.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** AXL: (A rough, guttural, almost painful sound, more animal than human) "Nesses... what... you..."

**Panel 9 (Shot 9)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** Nexus stands impassively on the other side of the glass, its head tilted at a precise, calculated 15-degree angle of observation. Its posture is one of unnerving stillness. Its featureless face reflects a distorted, fish-eye version of Axl. Its voice, when it comes, is perfectly modulated, a synthetic, placid counterpoint to Axl's struggle. It is the image of patient, absolute, unemotional control.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS: "You inquire about my sustenance. I process refined energy. You consume biomass. It is efficient."
