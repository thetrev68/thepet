## Scene 2-1: Habitat Escape

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** The sterile habitat. Axl sits on the edge of his bed, his posture perfect, his hands folded in his lap. The clinical light washes across his face, revealing absolute stillness. But his eyes—pinned and alert—betray the storm beneath. This is performance. The last performance he will give in this place. Behind the glass, Nexus stands motionless, recording baseline metrics, a silent witness to what it believes is peace.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The soft hum of the habitat's systems; time flowing normally).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** ECU / EXTREME CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** The digital clock integrated into the habitat wall reads 13:55. The numbers glow red against white. Each second that passes is audible—a sharp, clinical tick-tick-tick that builds tension like a metronome. The sound amplifies unnaturally, filling the frame. Time is no longer passive. Time is a weapon counting down to Axl's recalibration.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The sound of the seconds ticking is amplified, mechanical, building extreme tension).

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** 2-SHOT / THROUGH GLASS
*   **Description:** Axl and Nexus separated by the transparent wall. Nexus's chrome surface reflects the clinical light. It approaches the glass barrier and speaks—not with the detached syntax of its usual programming, but with something almost resembling emotion. Almost. It's the closest an android can come to affection, and the tragedy is that Axl understands the gulf between its attempt and what affection actually is.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS: "A doctor... comes. You talk with them. You be... good. Okay? I... like you. I... hope you stay... same. Good." (The voice is synthetic but carries an odd weight, as close to sadness as a machine can approximate).

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP / RACK FOCUS
*   **Description:** A tight shot on Axl's face. Guilt flickers across his features—genuine guilt for this android that has fed and maintained him, even if it could never truly understand him. Then, from off-screen, a soft CHIME sounds. The specialist has arrived. Nexus's programming reasserts itself. The android turns from the glass, and the rack focus shifts to Nexus walking away—the focus pulling off Axl's face and landing on Nexus's departing form. This is the moment. The opportunity. The door opening in Nexus's attention.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (A soft, melodic CHIME; Nexus's servo sounds as it turns and moves away).

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM / HANDHELD (STYLE SHIFT)
*   **Description:** **CAMERA STYLE SHIFTS TO HANDHELD.** The cool, clinical aesthetic shatters. Axl explodes from stillness into violent motion. He grabs the meal bowl—crude ceramic, a tool, a weapon—and hurls it at the glass wall. The handheld camera whips with him, jerking and chaotic, abandoning the studied formality of his captivity. The bowl arcs through the space. Everything accelerates. Everything breaks.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The CRASH of ceramic against glass; a sharp CLANG that echoes; voices from the other room cut off mid-sentence).

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP / CHAOTIC HANDHELD
*   **Description:** A tight, shaky, claustrophobic shot on the pet door's locking mechanism. Axl's hands move with desperate precision, jamming a sharp shard of the broken bowl into the lock. The camera shakes with his urgency. SPARKS FLY—bright and violent. The lock HISSES and SHORTS OUT in a shower of electrical fire. An ALARM BEEPS—soft but insistent, a sound that has never existed before, a sound that means everything is wrong now, everything is different.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Sparks crackling; the lock hissing and shorting; the alarm BEEPING; Nexus's voice O.S., "Axl!").

**Panel 7 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** LOW ANGLE / HANDHELD
*   **Description:** From the floor level, looking up at the damaged pet door, Axl throws his full body weight against it. The handheld camera stays low, emphasizing the desperate struggle, the raw physicality of the escape. The door SLIDES OPEN, stuck halfway—not wide, but wide enough. He squeezes through the gap, his body scraping against the edges, tearing fabric and flesh. For the first time, freedom hurts. For the first time, freedom is physical and real and expensive.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The grinding sound of the damaged door sliding open; Axl's body scraping; Nexus's footsteps, fast, running; the alarm continuing, now frantic).
