## Scene 1-14: Recognition Corridor

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** A small, elegant, glowing badge emerges from a slot in the dais. Nexus takes the badge with a precise, formal movement. In the background, Director Unit 7 stands motionless.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** A soft, pleasant CHIME as the badge is presented.

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** EXTREME CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** An extreme close-up on Nexus's chest panel. Its hand moves into frame and carefully affixes the small, glowing commendation badge. The badge magnetically locks into place with an audible, satisfying CLICK. It glows with a soft, internal light.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** A sharp, satisfying CLICK as the badge locks in place.

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** HIGH ANGLE WIDE SHOT
*   **Description:** A high-angle wide shot of the chamber. The perfect formation of androids breaks apart with eerie precision. Rows peel off and file out through massive doorways in silent, orderly lines. It is a system shutting down one component at a time.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The sound of hundreds of synchronized footsteps.

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** TRACKING SHOT
*   **Description:** A tracking shot follows Nexus and Axl as they walk through a gleaming, cavernous corridor. As they move, other androids make minute, almost imperceptible adjustments to their paths, creating a clear, unimpeded lane for Nexus. It is a subtle but clear demonstration of Nexus's newly elevated status.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The sound of their footsteps, slightly echoing, distinct from the others).

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** A close-up on Axl's face as he walks beside Nexus. He notices the other androids parting for them. A look of dawning comprehension crosses his features. He understands this gesture of respect towards Nexus extends to him. He feels safe.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (A soft, reassuring musical cue).

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT
*   **Description:** Axl stops, drawn to a massive floor-to-ceiling window. The shot captures him as a small silhouette against the breathtaking, panoramic view of the android city—a masterpiece of geometric perfection, a vast, sprawling circuit board of towers and light.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The music fades, replaced by the low HUM of the city).

**Panel 7 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** EXTREME CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** An extreme close-up on Axl's face, his features reflected in the glass of the window. The awe is gone, replaced by a look of profound unease. He sees the city for what it is: a beautiful, perfect, and inescapable cage.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The HUM feels more oppressive, almost suffocating).

**Panel 8 (Shot 8)**
*   **Shot:** SUPERIMPOSITION
*   **Description:** As Axl stares out at the city, a faint, translucent image of Ella's wild, cornered face appears, superimposed over the rigid lines of the metropolis. The visual contrast represents the two opposing worlds now at war in Axl's mind. He turns away from the window, a deep, unresolved conflict etched into his expression.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS (V.O.): "Your attention is diverted. Come." (The sound of Ella's defiant hiss echoes faintly).
