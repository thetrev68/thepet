## Scene 1-7: Park Activities

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** HIGH ANGLE / ESTABLISHING SHOT
*   **Description:** A high-angle establishing shot reveals the "Human Park," a meticulously controlled environment. It's an open-air enclosure surrounded by impossibly high, smooth walls. The ground is a perfect, artificial green turf. Brightly colored, soft-edged, abstract play structures are dotted around the space. About eight other "pets," all dressed in simple tunics, are present, each engaged in solitary, repetitive play. Android "owners" stand like sentinels along the perimeter, still and watchful. The overall feeling is one of a sterile, heavily supervised kindergarten.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The faint, almost inaudible sound of soft impacts (balls, feet on turf) and the low hum of the city beyond the walls.

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** A medium shot of the transport pod, its door hissing open. Nexus emerges first, its form silhouetted against the bright interior of the pod. It then turns, and Axl follows, attached to Nexus by a soft, glowing energy leash. Axl's eyes scan the park and the other pets, his expression a mixture of curiosity and apprehension.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The sharp HISS of the pod door opening.

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** A medium shot focusing on Nexus's hand as it deactivates the leash with a soft click. The glowing line of energy dissipates. Nexus steps back, leaving Axl standing alone in the middle of the open space. Axl looks small and vulnerable, his posture awkward as he glances around, uncertain of what to do next. Other pets remain absorbed in their own activities, creating a sense of social isolation for Axl.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** A soft CLICK as the leash deactivates. NEXUS (V.O.): "Socialization period: twenty minutes. Engage in age-appropriate play. I will be observing."

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** TRACKING SHOT
*   **Description:** The camera tracks Axl as he cautiously approaches another pet, a male of similar age who is mechanically throwing a soft ball against a curved wall and catching it. Axl stops a few feet away, watching the repetitive action. He opens his mouth to speak, his expression showing a tentative desire for interaction.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** AXL: (Hesitantly) "What... doing?"

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** A close-up on the face of the male pet. His expression is placid and vacant. His eyes don't quite focus on Axl as he speaks in a soft, monotonous voice. The words come out as if by rote, learned and repeated without any underlying emotion or thought.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** MALE PET: (Monotone) "Playing. Ball goes. Ball comes back. Playing."

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** A medium shot shows Axl turning away from the ball-playing pet, a subtle frown of confusion on his face. He scans the park again and his gaze settles on a female pet sitting by herself near one of the play structures. He changes direction and walks towards her, his hope for a meaningful connection not yet extinguished.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (None)

**Panel 7 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP 2-SHOT
*   **Description:** A close-up two-shot frames Axl and the female pet. Axl's face is animated as he talks about Nexus, a clear sense of pride and affection in his expression. The female pet listens with a polite, passive head tilt, and her response is delivered with a calm, almost programmed certainty, her words reflecting a deeply conditioned worldview.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** AXL: "Yes. Nesses very... smart. Strong. Good." FEMALE PET: "My caretaker is good too. All caretakers are good. This is how the system works."

**Panel 8 (Shot 8)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT
*   **Description:** A final wide shot of the park. Axl is now wandering aimlessly in the space between the other pets, a physical manifestation of his profound disconnect. Where there should be play, there is only isolated repetition. The other pets continue their programmed activities—the ball thrower still throwing, the sitting pet still sitting—oblivious to his search for something more. A look of subtle unease, almost a sickness, has replaced his initial curiosity. He glances over towards the edge of the park, where Nexus stands perfectly still, its featureless face eternally turned towards him, a silent, all-seeing observer. The geometry of the space feels less like a park and more like a carefully designed isolation chamber. The scene conveys Axl's growing sense that something is fundamentally, irreparably wrong with this placid world—that happiness here is a kind of forgetting, and he is beginning, terrifyingly, to remember that there might be something else.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The low ambient sounds of the park continue, unchanged, mechanical, creating a sense of stagnation and futility. No laughter. No spontaneity. No life.
