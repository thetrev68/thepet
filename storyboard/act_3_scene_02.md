## Scene 3-2: Nest Preparation

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** MONTAGE / FAST-PACED HANDHELD
*   **Description:** A fast-cut montage of the nest's transformation into a fortress. The handheld camera moves rapidly through the space, capturing the urgent, purposeful activity. Strays hauling salvaged materials, constructing barriers at choke points. Maya sharpening weapons—crude spears, blades made from reclaimed metal, each one a potential life. Axl practices with his spear, the weapon now an extension of his body, the muscle memory of combat embedding itself into his instincts. The energy is high, focused, electric. Three days compressed into moments. Time accelerating toward collision.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The sounds of construction—metal scraping, materials being moved; the sharp sound of stones being sharpened; footsteps; voices calling instructions; the ambient energy of preparation).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM / WHIP PAN
*   **Description:** A scout runs into the Nest, breathless, his face flushed with exertion and alarm. The camera whip pans to catch his arrival, the sudden movement matching his urgency. He's been watching the outer passages, and what he's seen demands immediate action. The purposeful activity freezes. Every face turns toward him. Every person understands that this moment has just collapsed the future into present.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** SCOUT: "They're coming. Big force. Three enforcer units. A command android." (His voice breathless, urgent; the whip pan sound crisp and sudden; the immediate silence of the nest as everyone stops and listens).

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Description:** A wide, static shot of the remaining fighters—fifteen of them—gathering around Koss. They are small. They are human. They are facing machines. But they are also a force that has chosen to stand rather than scatter. Koss gives his final speech, and it is the speech of someone who understands what he's asking: surrender your life to the possibility of death, or surrender your soul to the certainty of recapture. The strays listen. No one moves to leave. They are ready.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** KOSS: "This is it. We stop them here, or we run forever. Any of you want to leave, go now. I won't judge you." (Silence. No one moves.) KOSS: "Then we fight like we own this place. Because we do." (The words settling; the fire crackling; the sound of commitment made).
*   **Shot:** WIDE / STATIC HANDHELD
