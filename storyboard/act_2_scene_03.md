## Scene 2-3: City Chase

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM / HANDHELD TRACKING
*   **Description:** The camera follows closely behind Axl as he navigates a maze of cold, metallic service corridors designed for androids, not for flesh and blood. Everything is angular. Everything is hard. No soft edges. No accommodations for human fragility. He moves with desperation, constantly looking over his shoulder. The corridors are identical, repeating, a maze with no exit except deeper. Distant ALARMS echo—electronic cries that mean pursuit. He is being hunted through the machine city.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Distant alarms, echoing through corridors; his footsteps on cold steel; his ragged breathing; the mechanical hum of the city's infrastructure).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP / SHAKY HANDHELD
*   **Description:** A shaky, intimate close-up on his bare, bleeding feet slapping against cold steel grating. His soles are torn. Blood smears the metal. His arm scrapes against a sharp metal edge, drawing more blood. The camera doesn't flinch from this physicality. The escape has a cost. Freedom exacts payment in flesh and pain. Every step is agony. Every breath burns. But he keeps moving.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The wet sound of his feet on metal; his labored breathing; the sharp sound of his skin scraping against metal; distant alarms continuing).

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE / STATIC
*   **Description:** A rare, brief moment of stillness. A static shot in the chaos. Axl is a small, frantic figure running down a long, perfectly symmetrical service alley. The geometry is obsessive—repeating panels, repeating lines, a grid that extends to infinity. He is still trapped, just in a different kind of prison. Still enclosed. Still controlled. The architectural language of the android city allows no escape. Even flight is a kind of captivity.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (His footsteps echoing; alarms fading slightly, as if distance is his only refuge; the hum of the city never ceasing).
