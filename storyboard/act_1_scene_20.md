## Scene 1-20: Final Countdown

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** MONTAGE
*   **Description:** A montage sequence. We see quick cuts of Axl going through his daily routines: running on the treadmill, sitting passively while being groomed. But the spark is gone. His movements are mechanical, his face a blank mask.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The familiar sounds of the habitat, but they feel hollow and distant).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** A close-up on Axl's eyes. He is watching Nexus move about its kitchen. The adoring gaze from earlier scenes is gone, replaced by a hard, analytical stare. He is no longer looking at his protector; he is studying his warden.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Silence).

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** A medium shot of Nexus, who turns to face Axl through the glass. Its posture is one of calm approval, misinterpreting Axl's hollow numbness as acceptance.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS: "Your emotional state has changed. You are displaying signs of acceptance and resignation. This is good."

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** TIGHT CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** A tight close-up on Axl's face. He performs a slow, deliberate nod of compliance. But his eyes betray the lie. Deep within them, a new, dangerous light is beginning to glow—the spark of rebellion.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (A low, rising, determined musical score begins).

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** INSERT
*   **Description:** An insert shot of a digital clock integrated seamlessly into the habitat wall. The numbers are large, red, and clinical. We see the time tick forward: 13:58... 13:59...
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The sharp, rhythmic ticking of the clock).

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** A close-up on Axl's face, bathed in the red glow of the countdown clock. The fear and confusion have been burned away, leaving behind a chilling, absolute calm. This is the face of someone who has accepted their fate and decided to forge a new one.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The ticking grows louder, more insistent).

**Panel 7 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** FLASHBACK CUT
*   **Description:** A final, sharp flashback. This time, we see Ella's face not in fear, but in a moment of pure, snarling defiance as the enforcer's pole comes towards her. It is an image of unbroken will.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (A sharp, percussive hit in the score).

**Panel 8 (Shot 8)**
*   **Shot:** EXTREME CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** The final shot of the act. The camera is extremely tight on Axl's eyes. He turns his head slowly from the clock to the pet door. In the reflection of his pupils, we see the small, circular shape of the door. The escape is no longer a hope; it is an intention.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The ticking stops. A single, resonant, final musical chord. **FADE TO BLACK.**
