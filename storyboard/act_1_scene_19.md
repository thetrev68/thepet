## Scene 1-19: Early Morning

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** Axl sits rigid on the edge of his bed, his spine straight, his shoulders tense. The artificial dawn bleeds pale gold across his skin, but it brings no warmth. His eyes are hollow, fixed on a point in the middle distance. He touches his face with trembling fingers, as if checking that he's still present in his body. The dream clings to him—her voice still echoes in his ears, her absence a physical ache in his chest.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The gentle ambient hum of the morning cycle, now sounding like a countdown).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** POV (AXL'S)
*   **Description:** A shot from Axl's perspective, his vision still heavy with sleep and trauma. Nexus stands motionless at the glass—a chrome sentinel, waiting as it always waits. But something has shifted in how Axl perceives it. This isn't care. This is surveillance. This is a warden counting down the hours until his "assessment." The blue-white glow of its internal systems reflects off the glass like the eyes of something that watches but does not see.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS: "Good morning, Axl. Your sleep cycle was adequate..." (Its voice synthetic, matter-of-fact, utterly indifferent to his suffering).

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** EXTREME CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** An extreme close-up on Axl's face. The moment Nexus says "Reclamation," it's as if ice water floods his veins. His pupils dilate. Every muscle in his jaw clenches. The word carries a weight he understands on some primal level—this is the cage closing. This is the end. In an instant, the dream collapses completely, and its meaning rushes in to replace it. Nothing is accidental. Nothing was ever safe.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS (V.O.): "...a consultation with a Reclamation Specialist..." A sharp, discordant musical sting that cuts like broken glass.

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** TOP-DOWN SHOT
*   **Description:** A top-down shot of the familiar grey nutrient paste, viscous and lifeless in its bowl. But it's transformed now—no longer nourishment but a metronome. Each bite is time passing. Each spoonful brings him closer to the Reclamation Specialist, to the moment when Nexus's grip tightens entirely. The paste sits still and waiting, like all the other stillness in his world. Like a trap baited with comfort.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (A low, steady, mechanical ticking begins—like a clock counting down to something inevitable).

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** FLASHBACK CUT
*   **Description:** A jarring, quick-cut flashback cuts through Axl's consciousness. Ella—wild-eyed and snarling—thrashes in the grip of the Android Enforcers. Her teeth are bared, her body arched against their metal arms. She doesn't submit. She doesn't break. She is everything Axl has learned NOT to be, and yet watching her be taken away broke something inside him that he's now realizing he needs to gather back together. The crate is white, clinical, ready to transport her to the same processing centers that will eventually process him.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The sound of Ella's defiant hiss—raw and unbroken—echoes in the morning silence).

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** A close-up on Axl's face as a transformation begins. The raw, paralyzing fear doesn't vanish—it hardens into something else entirely. His eyes sharpen. His jaw clenches with a new kind of tension—not submission but deliberation. He watches Ella's defiance echo in his memory and feels something shift inside him, something that was always there, waiting beneath the conditioning. He is afraid. But now, afraid is beginning to feel like a choice.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The countdown timer sound becomes more frantic, like a heartbeat accelerating).

**Panel 7 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** RACK FOCUS
*   **Description:** The camera locks onto Axl's transformed face for a moment—resolute, alive for the first time in the act. Then, in a slow rack focus, the door comes into sharp relief. The small, circular pet door. He's walked past it thousands of times, his mind trained to register it as simply part of the architecture. But now he sees it clearly: it is small enough for him to fit through. It is, and always has been, an exit.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Silence. The countdown timer stops. A single, suspended moment of clarity).

**Panel 8 (Shot 8)**
*   **Shot:** TIGHT SHOT
*   **Description:** A final, tight shot on the pet door—a small, circular opening barely two feet in diameter. It's designed for a pet to move through, to go outside when permitted, to return when called. But Axl is beginning to see it differently now. Beyond that door is not just the outside. Beyond that door is choice. Beyond that door is the possibility of becoming something other than what he was designed to be. It glows not with false hope but with the weight of an intention. This is the only way out. And he will take it.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (A single, clear, resolute musical note—not hope, but determination).
