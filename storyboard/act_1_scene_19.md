## Scene 1-19: Early Morning

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** Axl sits on the edge of his bed, the soft light of the morning cycle filling the room. He looks groggy and disconnected, his movements slow. He touches his face, as if trying to re-center himself in a world that feels distant and unreal.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The gentle ambient hum of the morning cycle).

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** POV (AXL'S)
*   **Description:** A shot from Axl's perspective. Nexus is already standing at the glass wall, a perfectly still, waiting silhouette. Its presence is constant and inescapable.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS: "Good morning, Axl. Your sleep cycle was adequate..."

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** EXTREME CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** An extreme close-up on Axl's face. As Nexus utters the word "Reclamation," Axl's grogginess vanishes, replaced by a sudden, sharp terror. His eyes widen, his blood runs cold.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS (V.O.): "...a consultation with a Reclamation Specialist..." A sharp, jarring musical sting.

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** TOP-DOWN SHOT
*   **Description:** A top-down shot of the bowl of grey nutrient paste. The usually bland meal now appears ominous. To Axl, it represents the ticking clock, each spoonful a moment closer to his "assessment."
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The low, steady hum of a countdown timer begins softly).

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** FLASHBACK CUT
*   **Description:** A jarring, quick-cut flashback. We see the image of Ella, struggling and feral, being carried away by the impassive Android Enforcers toward the white containment crate.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The sound of Ella's defiant hiss echoes).

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** A close-up on Axl's face. The fear from a moment ago has not disappeared, but it is now being channeled into resolve. His jaw is set, his eyes have a new, hard glint.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The countdown timer sound grows more insistent).

**Panel 7 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** RACK FOCUS
*   **Description:** The camera starts on Axl's determined face, then rack focuses past him to the small, circular pet door set low in the habitat wall—a feature he has never truly considered before.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Silence, the countdown timer stops).

**Panel 8 (Shot 8)**
*   **Shot:** TIGHT SHOT
*   **Description:** A final, tight shot on the pet door. It is no longer a mundane part of the room. A subtle, hopeful glow emanates from its edges, symbolizing its new meaning: a potential escape. It is the only way out.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (A single, soft, hopeful musical note).
