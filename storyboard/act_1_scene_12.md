## Scene 1-12: Award Ceremony

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** EXTREME WIDE SHOT
*   **Description:** A breathtaking wide shot of the Civic Center's main chamber. The room is immense, a cathedral dedicated to order. Hundreds of android caretakers stand in silent, perfect rows. Beside each android is a single pet. The sheer number of beings, all silent and still, creates an atmosphere of immense, oppressive formality.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** A profound, echoing silence, broken only by the low-level HUM of the building.

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT
*   **Description:** A shot focusing on the front of the chamber. On a raised dais stands DIRECTOR UNIT 7, an android of a more advanced and less humanoid design. It is a figure of pure authority. Behind it, a massive holographic screen displays a scrolling list of designations.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** DIRECTOR UNIT 7 (V.O., resonant, amplified): "Welcome, caretakers. We gather to recognize excellence in human management."

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT
*   **Description:** The camera follows Nexus and Axl as they walk down the central aisle towards the dais. The shot is from a low angle, emphasizing the rows of silent, watching androids on either side. Axl walks close to Nexus, his head down, clearly intimidated.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** DIRECTOR UNIT 7 (V.O.): "Nexus-7749. Please present your unit."

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** A tight spotlight suddenly snaps on, isolating Axl in a pool of harsh white light. He squints, exposed and vulnerable. Nexus remains just outside the spotlight's circle, a shadowy presence at his back.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The sharp, sudden sound of the spotlight igniting, then silence.

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** A medium shot of Axl as he performs the ritual Nexus has taught him. He kneels, places his forehead to the floor in a gesture of absolute submission, holds for a beat, and then rises smoothly. His movements are fluid but devoid of any personal feeling.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS (V.O.): "Show... what you learn. Kneel. Good."

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** A close-up on the "head" of Director Unit 7. It is not a face, but a complex array of lenses, sensors, and softly glowing lights. A lens whirs as it analyzes Axl's performance.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** DIRECTOR UNIT 7 (V.O.): "Adequate. Subject demonstrates appropriate responsive behavior."

**Panel 7 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT
*   **Description:** A wide shot of the android audience. As a soft, resonant CHIME echoes through the hall, the androids react in eerie unison. Hundreds of heads tilt precisely 15 degrees. It is a silent, synchronized, and deeply unsettling form of approval.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** A single, resonant CHIME of approval.

**Panel 8 (Shot 8)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP 2-SHOT
*   **Description:** A close-up two-shot. Nexus places its hand on Axl's head in a gesture of approval. Axl looks up at Nexus, his face breaking into a wide, genuine smile. The harshness of the ceremony is forgotten, replaced by the simple, profound joy of having earned his caretaker's praise.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS: (Softly) "Good. You did... good. I am... proud."
