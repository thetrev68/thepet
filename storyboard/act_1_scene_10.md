## Scene 1-10: Preparation Room

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT
*   **Description:** A wide shot of a hyper-sterile, white and chrome room. Nexus stands before a large, polished wall panel that serves as a mirror. It makes a minute adjustment to a panel on its own arm, the gesture precise and self-evaluative. In the corner of the room, Axl sits on a low bench, watching Nexus with a look of pure confusion.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The faint, almost imperceptible sound of a servo as Nexus makes an adjustment.

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** A close-up shot of Nexus's reflection in the mirrored panel. We see its featureless face, a smooth, impassive mask of chrome. The reflection is perfect and distortion-free, emphasizing the android's cold, manufactured perfection.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Silence)

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** Nexus turns away from the mirror to face Axl. Its posture is even more erect and formal than usual. There's a subtle shift in its stance that conveys a sense of importance and pride as it delivers the news about the award.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS: "Today is significant. I have been selected for the Annual Excellence in Pet Care Award. This reflects optimal performance in your maintenance and development."

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** A close-up on Axl's face as he processes the word "Good" and hears what he interprets as pride in Nexus's tone. Something shifts in him—a chemical release of satisfaction so profound it borders on euphoria. He visibly straightens up, puffing his chest out in an unconscious attempt to mimic the posture of importance, the physical manifestation of purpose finally realized. For the first time, he feels that his existence has meaning. That he matters. The tragedy is that this meaning is entirely constructed, entirely dependent on another's approval, yet it fills him completely with a joy that is genuine, uncomplicated, and utterly heartbreaking.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** AXL: (Voice carrying genuine emotion for the first time) "Good?" NEXUS (V.O.): "Yes. Good. We will attend together. You should be proud." (These words land as absolute truth in Axl's developing consciousness, as definitive as physics).

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** A medium shot showing Nexus holding up a new tunic for Axl. The tunic is made of a pristine, brilliant white fabric that seems to almost glow in the clinical light of the room. It is held out to Axl, a clear, silent command.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS: "Wear this."

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** Axl is now wearing the new tunic. The shot is from a slightly low angle, looking up at him as he looks down at his own chest. The tunic fits him perfectly. For the first time, his expression is not one of confusion or submission, but a flicker of self-worth and value.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (A soft, rising, positive musical note).

**Panel 7 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM 2-SHOT
*   **Description:** A final, formal two-shot. Nexus and Axl stand side-by-side, facing forward as if posing for a portrait. Nexus is a pillar of polished chrome, and Axl, in his pristine new tunic, looks like the perfect, well-maintained pet. They are a united front, a testament to Nexus's "Excellence in Pet Care."
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Silence, a feeling of readiness).
