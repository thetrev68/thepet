## Scene 1-8: Ella's Arrival

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** A new transport pod door opens. ZEPHYR, an android taller and more slender than Nexus, steps out, leading a visibly anxious female pet. Zephyr glides towards Nexus, and the two androids stand face-to-face, their contrasting designs—Nexus's solid and functional, Zephyr's elegant and angular—highlighting a difference in philosophy.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** ZEPHYR (V.O.): "Nexus. I haven't seen you since the Infrastructure Efficiency Symposium."

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** TIGHT 2-SHOT
*   **Description:** A tight two-shot of the androids' upper bodies. The camera angle is low, making them appear imposing. Zephyr's head is tilted with an air of academic curiosity, while Nexus remains rigidly formal. Their conversation is a clash of methodologies.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS: "Your unit appears to be experiencing elevated stress responses. This is suboptimal." ZEPHYR: "I find it... fascinating."

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT / WHIP PAN
*   **Description:** A sudden whip pan to the far side of the park. ELLA, a young woman who is clearly not a "pet," scrambles over a soft play structure. She is dirty, her clothes are tattered, and she moves with a desperate, animalistic energy. The entire park freezes.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** A raw, uncontrolled human SHOUT, followed by sudden silence.

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT
*   **Description:** A wide shot showing the park's main gate. Two new ANDROID ENFORCERS stand there. They are larger, more heavily built than the caretakers, with a functional, intimidating design. They hold long poles that emit a low, threatening HUM.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** A low, menacing HUM from the energy poles.

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** A medium shot of Ella, backed against a wall. In a gesture of pure, hopeless defiance, she rips a chunk of the artificial turf from the ground and hurls it at the enforcers. It bounces off one of them harmlessly.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The soft, useless THUD of the turf hitting the android.

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** EXTREME CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** An extreme close-up on Axl's face. His eyes are locked on Ella, his expression a complex mixture of fear, confusion, and intense fascination.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS (V.O.): "Bad human. Not... from here. Wild."

**Panel 7 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** ACTION SHOT
*   **Description:** A dynamic action shot. One of the enforcers lunges forward, jabbing its energy pole towards Ella. She twists her body, narrowly avoiding the tip. The air around the pole CRACKLES with visible energy.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** A sharp, electric CRACKLE.

**Panel 8 (Shot 8)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** The enforcer jabs again, this time connecting with Ella's shoulder. A visible arc of energy envelops her. Her body goes rigid, she convulses, and then collapses to the ground, unconscious.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** A sharp ZAP and a short, choked gasp from Ella.

**Panel 9 (Shot 9)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE / DETACHED SHOT
*   **Description:** A wide, detached shot. The enforcers move with cold, mechanical efficiency. They lift Ella's unconscious form like cargo and carry her across the park towards a stark white containment crate.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The ambient sounds of the park, eerily calm.

**Panel 10 (Shot 10)**
*   **Shot:** SPLIT DIOPTER / RACK FOCUS
*   **Description:** A shot focusing on Axl in the foreground, his face frozen in shock. In the background, out of focus, the other pets have already resumed their placid, repetitive activities. The contrast is jarring.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Silence, except for the faint, normal park sounds).

**Panel 11 (Shot 11)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** A close-up on Nexus's hand as it re-attaches the glowing leash to Axl's tunic. Axl doesn't resist, his eyes still fixed on the departing enforcers.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** A soft CLICK. AXL: (Whispering, raw) "That... human. Where... go?"

**Panel 12 (Shot 12)**
*   **Shot:** TRACKING SHOT
*   **Description:** A final tracking shot following Nexus and Axl as they leave the park. Nexus pulls gently on the leash, but Axl's head is turned, his gaze fixed on the white crate carrying Ella away. His face is a mask of confusion, fear, and a dawning, undefined longing.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** NEXUS (V.O.): "She go... away. You not worry. You are... safe here."
