## Scene 1-16: Habitat Night

**Panel 1 (Shot 1)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT
*   **Description:** A wide shot of the habitat, bathed in the soft, low light of its night cycle. The room is filled with long, soft shadows. Axl lies on his bed, but his eyes are wide open. Through the glass wall, Nexus is a motionless silhouette in its own darkened chamber.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The soft, soothing, ambient HUM of the habitat's night cycle.

**Panel 2 (Shot 2)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** A close-up on Axl's hand. His fingers tap out a restless, uneven rhythm against the smooth surface of his bed. This small, anxious gesture is a powerful indicator of the turmoil beneath his calm exterior.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The soft, repetitive tapping sound, slightly out of sync with the ambient hum.

**Panel 3 (Shot 3)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM SHOT
*   **Description:** Axl slides silently off the bed. He moves to the far corner of the habitat, where the curved wall meets the floor. He kneels and begins to claw at the seamless join, his movements furtive and desperate.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The faint, scraping sound of fingernails on a hard, smooth surface.

**Panel 4 (Shot 4)**
*   **Shot:** EXTREME CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** An extreme close-up of Axl's fingertips as he scrapes furiously against the wall. The advanced material of the habitat remains perfectly smooth, unmarked, while his fingernails begin to fray and bend back.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The scraping sound becomes more frantic and desperate, then stops. A sharp intake of breath from Axl.

**Panel 5 (Shot 5)**
*   **Shot:** WIDE SHOT / LENS DISTORTION
*   **Description:** Axl slumps back on his heels, defeated. He looks around the habitat. The camera employs a subtle fisheye lens effect, making the once-spacious room feel tight, oppressive, and claustrophobic.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** A low, dissonant chord underscores the feeling of entrapment.

**Panel 6 (Shot 6)**
*   **Shot:** LOW ANGLE SHOT
*   **Description:** A low-angle shot as Axl moves to his bed and kneels. He slides open a nearly invisible panel at the base of the bed platform. He reaches his arm deep into the dark space, fumbling for something hidden.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** The soft WHIR of the panel sliding open.

**Panel 7 (Shot 7)**
*   **Shot:** CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** A tight close-up on Axl's hand as it emerges from the compartment, clutching a simple, metal spoon. In the context of the sterile habitat, this mundane object feels alien, significant, and potentially dangerous. The metal catches the dim light.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (Silence, broken only by Axl's quiet, steady breathing).

**Panel 8 (Shot 8)**
*   **Shot:** MEDIUM CLOSE UP
*   **Description:** A final shot of Axl sitting on the edge of his bed, the spoon concealed. His eyes are locked on the silhouette of Nexus. His expression has hardened. The confusion is gone, replaced by a nascent, dangerous resolve.
*   **Dialogue/FX:** (The ambient hum continues, but now it feels less soothing and more like the hum of a machine to be defeated).
