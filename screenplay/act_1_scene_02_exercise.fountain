INT. HABITAT - EXERCISE ROOM - LATER

A treadmill dominates the space. It's sleek, almost luxurious by pet standards. Soft padding. Ergonomic.

Axl is already running. His breathing is steady. His body is in excellent condition: no fat, good muscle tone, the body of something well-maintained.

On the wall ahead of him, a screen flashes IMAGES:

A CARTOON ANDROID with a friendly, geometric face:

"Keep going, Axl! You're doing great!"

Then a different image. A DOG (Axl has never seen one) running joyfully through a park.

"Running is fun!"

Then: A SMILING HUMAN CHILD on a playground.

"Exercise makes you happy!"

Axl's eyes flick to these images. He doesn't quite understand them, but they seem to suggest something positive. He runs a bit harder.

Behind the glass, Nexus watches. Monitoring. Recording data.

The treadmill's pace increases slightly, a gentle push. Axl adjusts, breathing harder but maintaining form.

His face shows concentration, not joy. But there's something in his eyes that suggests he's aware of Nexus watching him. He's performing.

The run continues for exactly twenty minutes.

Then the treadmill gradually slows.

Axl's breathing settles. Sweat beads on his skin.

NEXUS
(through a speaker, speaking clearly and slowly)
Good job. You run... good. Very good. Body is... strong.

!Axl makes an affirmative grunt. He's pleased to have pleased Nexus.

NEXUS
Water time... soon. Thirty... minutes. You get... ready. You drink... water.

!Axl nods and moves toward the bathroom.
