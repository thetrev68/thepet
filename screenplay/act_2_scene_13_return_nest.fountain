INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NEST - NIGHT

The strays are distributing the medical supplies. This will help them survive the winter. This is significant.

Koss approaches Axl, who is sitting by the fire, exhausted but exhilarated.

KOSS
You did good today. You're learning.

AXL
I was scared.

KOSS
Good. Scared keeps you alive. Panic kills you. You were scared but you moved. That's the difference.

!He sits beside Axl.

KOSS
You know what your problem is going to be?

AXL
What?

KOSS
You're going to want to go back. When it gets hard enough, when you're cold enough, hungry enough, hurting enough—you're going to think about your habitat. About Nexus. About comfort.

AXL
No. I don't.

KOSS
You will. And that's when you'll have a choice to make. Stay because you want to, or leave because you think it's easier to go back.

!He stands.

KOSS
Most pets who escape eventually get reclaimed. Because they can't handle the cost of freedom. I hope you're different.

!He walks away, leaving Axl alone with this thought.

Axl looks at the fire. At the strays around him. At Ella, who's watching him from across the nest.

He thinks about Nexus. About the habitat. About how perfect it was. How safe.

And he thinks about the spear in his hands. About the fear in the tunnel. About learning to make things. About being alive.

He doesn't know if he can handle the cost of freedom.

But he knows he has to try.
