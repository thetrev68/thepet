INT. NEXUS'S RESIDENTIAL UNIT - PREPARATION ROOM - DAY

A minimalist space. Everything chrome and white. Sterile.

Nexus stands in front of what might be called a mirror—a reflective panel—examining itself with something that could be called vanity, if androids could experience vanity.

It adjusts the angle of one of its panels. Checks the alignment of its seams.

Axl watches from the corner, confused.

NEXUS
Today is significant. I have been selected for the Annual Excellence in Pet Care Award. This reflects optimal performance in your maintenance and development.

Axl doesn't fully understand, but he understands pride. There's pride in Nexus's tone.

NEXUS
Your role is to represent my work. You will accompany me to the ceremony. Your appearance and behavior will reflect on my status.

AXL
(attempting enthusiasm)
Good?

NEXUS
Yes. Good. We will attend together. You should be proud.

And Axl is. He straightens slightly, as if standing taller somehow makes him better.

Nexus produces a NEW TUNIC for Axl. It's the same style, but pristine. Unblemished. Almost formal.

NEXUS
Wear this.

Axl changes. The tunic fits perfectly. Of course it does. Nexus knows his measurements precisely.

When Axl looks down at himself, he sees something like value.
