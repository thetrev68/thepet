INT. HABITAT - MAIN ROOM - EVENING

The light has shifted. The habitat's lighting has dimmed to an evening tone—soft golds instead of clinical whites.

Axl sits on his bed, wearing a clean tunic. His hair is dry and neat. He looks well-kept. Peaceful, even.

Nexus stands nearby, perfectly still. It's not sitting—androids don't sit—but its posture suggests a kind of... availability.

This is story time.

NEXUS
Today... I tell you... about city. You listen. Okay?

Axl settles back on his bed, his eyes on Nexus. He likes when Nexus speaks. There's a rhythm to it, even if he doesn't understand all the words.

NEXUS
Long... long time ago. We made... city. For humans. We make... shelter. Food. Safe place.

Axl watches Nexus. The android's movements are minimal, but precise. One hand gestures occasionally—not natural, but clearly programmed.

NEXUS
Before... humans... alone. They hurt... each other. Now... they safe. We... take care. No hurt.

Axl's brow furrows slightly. Some of this reaches him. Some doesn't.

AXL
(attempting)
Before... bad?

NEXUS
Before... bad. Pain. Now... good. You... safe. Yes?

Nexus pauses. Its head tilts slightly—a gesture that reads as thoughtful.

NEXUS
You... are pet. My pet. I... care for you. Very much care. You are... special. You understand?

Axl nods slowly. He knows this, in some way. He is special because he is Nexus's.

NEXUS
Other humans... together. Many. Not like you. You... alone. With me. This... is good thing.

There's something in the way Nexus says this. Not quite pride, but something adjacent to it. Ownership, perhaps. Or the programming of ownership.

Axl seems to absorb this. He looks around his habitat—the soft walls, the comfortable bed, the glass view to the kitchen where Nexus prepares his food.

It's nice. He knows this.

But something in his eyes suggests that knowing he's "privileged" doesn't quite fill the yearning he feels.

NEXUS
Do you have questions about this information?

Axl opens his mouth. His jaw works. He wants to ask something, but he doesn't have the words.

He tries:

AXL
(struggling)
Outside... what... outside?

NEXUS
Outside... is big. Confusing. Loud. Your home... safe. Quiet. Better for you.

AXL
(frustrated)
But... see?

He gestures toward the window. The edge of a building is visible, and far beyond it, the outline of the android city—sleek, tall, gleaming.

NEXUS
You see... sometimes. When we go... places. You see... other humans. This enough.

AXL
(trying harder)
Want... go... see more.

NEXUS
This... not normal. Other humans... happy. You... different. But is okay.

Nexus moves closer to Axl. Again, that hand gesture—almost a caress—over Axl's head.

NEXUS
You are curious. You want... to know. This... not bad. I watch. I keep... safe.

Axl doesn't understand all of this, but he understands the gist: he's different, and Nexus has noticed.

Whether this is good or bad, Axl can't tell.

NEXUS
Now... sleep time. You tired. You need... sleep.

Nexus withdraws its hand.

Axl lies back on his bed. Nexus activates a soft, ambient sound—something between music and white noise. Designed to be soothing.

Nexus stands at the edge of the habitat, watching.

AXL
(drowsy, but with intention)
Nesses... stay?

It's a question. Will you stay near me?

NEXUS
I... stay. I watch you. Always. Even... when you sleep.

It's not the same as staying, but it seems to satisfy Axl. His eyes close.

Nexus remains motionless, watching the rise and fall of Axl's breathing, monitoring his sleep patterns on some internal display only it can see.

There's something almost paternal in the way it watches.

Or the perfect simulation of something paternal.

The lights in the habitat dim further. The ambient sound continues.
