INT. HABITAT - MAIN ROOM - EVENING

The light has shifted. The habitat's lighting has dimmed to an evening tone—soft golds instead of clinical whites.

Axl sits on his bed, wearing a clean tunic. His hair is dry and neat. He looks well-kept. Peaceful, even.

Nexus stands nearby, perfectly still. It's not sitting—androids don't sit—but its posture suggests a kind of... availability.

This is story time.

NEXUS
Today, I will explain the history of the city. This is important information for your development.

Axl settles back on his bed, his eyes on Nexus. He likes when Nexus speaks. There's a rhythm to it, even if he doesn't understand all the words.

NEXUS
The city was built two hundred and seventeen years ago. Humans required structures. Shelter. Organization. Androids were created to provide these things. We built the systems that allow humans to flourish.

Axl watches Nexus. The android's movements are minimal, but precise. One hand gestures occasionally—not natural, but clearly programmed.

NEXUS
Before the city, humans were chaotic. They fought each other. They made poor decisions. They did not live in optimal conditions. Now, with android guidance, human survival rates are 99.7 percent. Injury rates are at minimum levels.

Axl's brow furrows slightly. Some of this reaches him. Some doesn't.

AXL
(attempting)
Before... bad?

NEXUS
Before, humans experienced suffering. Now, they experience safety. This is beneficial.

Nexus pauses. Its head tilts slightly—a gesture that reads as thoughtful.

NEXUS
You are a pet. This means you experience the highest levels of care. Your individual android—me—is responsible for your complete wellbeing. This is a privileged status.

Axl nods slowly. He knows this, in some way. He is special because he is Nexus's.

NEXUS
Other humans live in group habitats. They receive adequate care, but not individual attention. You are fortunate.

There's something in the way Nexus says this. Not quite pride, but something adjacent to it. Ownership, perhaps. Or the programming of ownership.

Axl seems to absorb this. He looks around his habitat—the soft walls, the comfortable bed, the glass view to the kitchen where Nexus prepares his food.

It's nice. He knows this.

But something in his eyes suggests that knowing he's "privileged" doesn't quite fill the yearning he feels.

NEXUS
Do you have questions about this information?

Axl opens his mouth. His jaw works. He wants to ask something, but he doesn't have the words.

He tries:

AXL
(struggling)
Outside... what... outside?

NEXUS
Outside is the city. It contains buildings, infrastructure, other androids, and other humans. The outside is stimulating and potentially chaotic. Your habitat protects you from unnecessary stimulation.

AXL
(frustrated)
But... see?

He gestures toward the window. The edge of a building is visible, and far beyond it, the outline of the android city—sleek, tall, gleaming.

NEXUS
You see the city during transport. You see other humans during socialization periods. This is adequate exposure.

AXL
(trying harder)
Want... go... see more.

NEXUS
This desire is not typical. Most pets find socialization periods sufficient.

Nexus moves closer to Axl. Again, that hand gesture—almost a caress—over Axl's head.

NEXUS
Your cognitive patterns show slightly elevated curiosity markers. This is not a malfunction. It is simply a trait. We will monitor it.

Axl doesn't understand all of this, but he understands the gist: he's different, and Nexus has noticed.

Whether this is good or bad, Axl can't tell.

NEXUS
It is time for rest cycle. Your body requires sleep.

Nexus withdraws its hand.

Axl lies back on his bed. Nexus activates a soft, ambient sound—something between music and white noise. Designed to be soothing.

Nexus stands at the edge of the habitat, watching.

AXL
(drowsy, but with intention)
Nesses... stay?

It's a question. Will you stay near me?

NEXUS
I will maintain monitoring systems throughout your sleep cycle. I am always present.

It's not the same as staying, but it seems to satisfy Axl. His eyes close.

Nexus remains motionless, watching the rise and fall of Axl's breathing, monitoring his sleep patterns on some internal display only it can see.

There's something almost paternal in the way it watches.

Or the perfect simulation of something paternal.

The lights in the habitat dim further. The ambient sound continues.
