EXT. TRANSPORT POD - DAY

The white pod glides smoothly through the city streets. Through the viewport, Axl watches the blur of android infrastructure pass by—gleaming towers, geometric buildings, streets empty of chaos.

He presses his face closer to the glass, eyes wide.

NEXUS sits across from him, perfectly still. It notices Axl's attention.

NEXUS
You are displaying heightened interest in the external environment. This is expected. Exposure to varied stimuli supports psychological development.

!Axl doesn't respond. He's transfixed by the city—its cleanliness, its order, its alienness.

A NOTIFICATION CHIMES softly on Nexus's surface.

NEXUS
Socialization period commences in two minutes. Behavioral parameters are as follows: remain within designated enclosure, engage in low-impact activity, maintain proximity to me or other designated android supervisors. Do you acknowledge?

AXL
(reflexive)
Hmph.

!An affirmative grunt.

The pod begins to slow.
