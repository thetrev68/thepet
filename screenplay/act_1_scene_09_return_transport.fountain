INT. TRANSPORT POD - RETURN - DAY

The pod glides smoothly back through the city.

Axl stares out the viewport but doesn't really see. His mind is elsewhere.

NEXUS monitors his vitals silently.

NEXUS
Your cognitive patterns have changed. Elevated activity in sectors associated with curiosity and concern. You are processing the incident incorrectly.

AXL
(barely audible)
What... stray?

NEXUS
A human without proper caretaking. Without structure. Without safety. It experiences suffering. Reclamation will end this.

AXL
Stray... alone?

NEXUS
It is now being placed in proper care. This is beneficial. You should not empathize with it.

!NEXUS pauses. A beat of silence.

NEXUS
Empathy toward non-domesticated humans is counterproductive. You are safe. You are cared for. This is what matters.

!Axl nods slowly, accepting this.

But in his eyes, something lingers.

The image of Ella—wild, defiant, unbroken—stays with him.

And that yearning he felt before? It has a shape now.
