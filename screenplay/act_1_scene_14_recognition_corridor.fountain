INT. ANDROID CIVIC CENTER - MULTIPLE LOCATIONS - CONTINUOUS

DIRECTOR UNIT 7
The following units are recognized for Excellence in Pet Care. All others will implement corrective measures.

!Another CHIME. More subtle android movements of recognition.

Nexus receives a small, glowing object—a badge or commendation of some kind. Ceremonial, but significant.

Nexus attaches it to its chest panel. A mark of status.

DIRECTOR UNIT 7
Ceremony concludes. Return to assignments.

!The android chamber begins to move. The formation breaks down. Androids file out in orderly fashion, their pets following.

Nexus guides Axl by the back. As they walk, other androids shift slightly aside, making space for them to pass.

A gesture of respect, Axl realizes.

Nexus is respected.

Which means Axl is protected.

Which means Axl is safe.

---

As they walk through the gleaming halls, Axl catches sight of a WINDOW overlooking the city.

For a moment, he pauses, looking out at the vast expanse of the android world—all those towers, all that order, all that perfection.

And for the first time, he sees it not as beautiful, but as suffocating.

All that perfection. All that control. All that certainty.

He thinks of Ella. Wild. Chaotic. Terrified. Being dragged away.

And he thinks: Which is better? This perfection, or that chaos?

NEXUS
(noticing the pause)
Your attention is diverted. Come.

!Axl turns away from the window.

But the question lingers.
