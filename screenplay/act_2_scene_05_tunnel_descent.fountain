EXT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

The entrance to an ancient tunnel system. The stairs descend into blackness.

Ella leads the way, moving with sure steps. She's navigated this path a thousand times.

Behind her, Axl follows, his eyes struggling to adjust to the darkness.

ELLA
(calling back, not looking at him)
My name is Ella. I was born in the tunnels. I've never been a pet. I've never been domesticated.

AXL
What... what that mean?

ELLA
It means I'm free. You're about to find out if that's better or worse than captivity.

!She descends deeper.

The last of the sunlight fades behind them.

Axl takes a breath and follows.
