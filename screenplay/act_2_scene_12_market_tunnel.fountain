EXT. OLD MARKET TUNNEL - DAY

The strays move through a cavernous space that was once a commercial hub. Before the androids. Before everything was sterile and ordered.

There are remnants of the old world everywhere—collapsed storefronts, shattered displays, rusted machinery.

Ella leads with her spear ready. Koss covers the rear. The others move in loose formation, alert.

AXL
(whispering to Ella)
Is it dangerous?

ELLA
(not whispering)
If it is, you should want to know.

She doesn't slow down. She doesn't lower her voice. She just moves, confident and alive.

They find a section where the old displays are still somewhat intact. Sealed containers. Plastic storage units.

MAYA
(examining them)
These haven't been touched. The androids never came this deep.

Koss uses a tool to pry open one of the containers.

Inside: medical supplies. Bandages. Antiseptics. Things the strays need.

KOSS
Good find. Load what we can carry.

Axl helps gather the supplies. He's working as part of a unit now. Contributing.

Then—

A sound. Distant, but unmistakable.

The whine of an ENFORCER UNIT.

The strays freeze.

ELLA
(quiet, urgent)
They don't come this deep. Move. Now.

They gather what they can and move quickly through the tunnel, taking a path Ella seems to know by instinct.

Behind them, the enforcer sound gets closer.

Axl's heart pounds. This is real danger. Not the controlled danger of his habitat. Real danger.

They run.

The tunnel branches. Ella chooses a direction without hesitation. The group follows.

The enforcer sound fades, but doesn't disappear entirely. It's searching.

They move in silence for what feels like hours.

Finally, they emerge into a section Axl recognizes—deeper in their home tunnels. Safe.

They stop. They breathe.

No one speaks for a long moment.

Then Koss looks at Axl.

KOSS
You kept up. You didn't panic. You followed.

AXL
(breathing hard)
What we do?

ELLA
We lived. That's all there is.
