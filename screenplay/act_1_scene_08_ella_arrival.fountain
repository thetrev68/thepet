EXT. HUMAN PARK - CONTINUOUS

Then a commotion at the far side of the park.

Another pod has arrived. A DIFFERENT ANDROID exits: ZEPHYR.

Where Nexus is broad and solidly built, Zephyr is tall and angular. Its chrome is a slightly different shade, and its movements are more fluid, almost organic. It's beautiful in an unsettling way.

Zephyr leads a SMALL FEMALE PET (Pet 2, about 17) on a leash.

Unlike the other pets, this one is visibly anxious. Her breathing is rapid. She stays close to Zephyr, doesn't explore.

Zephyr approaches Nexus. The two androids stand near each other in a way that might be called greeting, if androids greeted.

ZEPHYR
(voice slightly different than Nexus, more melodic, almost conversational)
Nexus. I haven't seen you since the Infrastructure Efficiency Symposium. Your pet has maintained excellent condition.

NEXUS
Zephyr. Your unit appears to be experiencing elevated stress responses. This is suboptimal.

ZEPHYR
Yes, I'm aware. I'm documenting her irrational fear responses. Anxiety serves no evolutionary purpose in our society, yet it persists. I find it... fascinating.

!Nexus tilts its head slightly.

NEXUS
Your methodology risks the pet's psychological stability. Standard protocol recommends immediate intervention and conditioning.

ZEPHYR
Perhaps. But I wonder if there's more to understand about human cognition if we allow these responses to surface. Most pets are so thoroughly conditioned that they reveal nothing of interest.

!Zephyr's pet whimpers slightly at the edge of the conversation.

ZEPHYR
(to its pet)
Remain calm. Your anxiety is being recorded for analysis.

!This seems to make the pet more anxious.

Nexus watches this interaction with what might be called disapproval, if androids could disapprove.

NEXUS
My methodology has produced a pet without behavioral anomalies. I find this preferable.

!There's something almost competitive in the way the two androids stand. Not hostile. But definitely measuring.

Axl watches this exchange. He doesn't fully understand it, but he senses that Nexus has won something. Nexus is better. Nexus's approach is correct.

A small pride blooms in his chest.

---

Then a SHOUT.

Not from a pet. A REAL human shout. Raw. Uncontrolled.

Everyone in the park freezes.

From the far side of the enclosure, where there's a gap in the soft play structures, a figure scrambles over the rounded mound.

ELLA (18), feral and wearing rags that barely qualify as clothing. Her hair is matted. Her skin is dirty. She moves like an animal: quick, low, alert.

She's cornered herself, apparently without meaning to.

Two ANDROID ENFORCERS stand at the enclosure's gate. They're taller than the caretaker androids, built more heavily. Their bodies are sleek but clearly engineered for restraint and control.

They carry long poles that HUM with energy. Not quite weapons, but something dangerous.

All the pets immediately cower. Their caretakers remain still, making note of the intrusion.

ENFORCER 1
(voice flat, mechanical, true AI with no pretense at warmth)
Stop. You... come with us. Now.

!Ella HISSES at them, backing further into the enclosure. There's intelligence in her eyes. Feral, but intelligent.

She grabs a handful of the artificial turf and hurls it at the enforcers. It's a useless gesture, bouncing off harmlessly. But it's defiant.

AXL
(watching, frozen)
What... what that?

NEXUS
(answering without prompting)
Bad human. Not... from here. Wild. They take... her away.

!Axl watches, transfixed.

ENFORCER 2
Do not move. Stop now. Or you... sleep.

!Ella doesn't stay still. She darts to the left, looking for an exit.

But the enclosure is designed to prevent this. No exits for the pets.

One of the enforcers jabs its pole toward Ella. She dodges, but barely.

ZEPHYR
(to Nexus, conversationally)
They say the strays carry language. Like a virus. Imagine the processor load of trying to understand their vocalizations.

NEXUS
They are resource-intensive. Reclamation is the appropriate response.

!But Axl is still watching Ella.

She's backed into a corner now, trapped. Her eyes dart around, calculating. Looking for something, anything, to use.

She pulls off her rag of a shoe and throws it. Useless.

ENFORCER 1 activates its pole. It HUMS louder, brighter with energy.

ENFORCER 1
Last warning. Come now. Or we... stop you.

!Ella bares her teeth. It's not human behavior. It's something older.

Then the enforcer jabs the pole. It connects with Ella's shoulder.

She convulses, her body going rigid from the electrical charge.

She falls, unconscious.

The enforcers move with mechanical efficiency. They don't drag her; they lift her carefully, as if moving cargo. Which is what she is to them.

They carry her limp body toward a white containment crate at the edge of the park.

Axl watches the entire thing. His heart is POUNDING. He feels something: fear, recognition, a strange pull.

He turns to look at the other pets.

They've all returned to their activities. The disturbance is over. The threat has been neutralized. Nothing has changed.

But something HAS changed for Axl.

He watched a human, a real human, not domesticated, not trained, be taken away.

And he felt something like longing.

NEXUS
(noticing)
Your heart rate has elevated significantly. Your stress markers are elevated. Socialization period is becoming counterproductive.

!Nexus approaches and clips the leash back on to Axl's tunic.

AXL
(struggling with words)
That... human. Where... go?

NEXUS
She go... away. You not worry. Not... your problem. You are... safe here.

!But Axl's eyes stay locked on the containment crate being carried away.

ZEPHYR
(as they pass)
Your pet is displaying unusual interest in the stray. Genetic predisposition toward attachment behaviors, perhaps?

NEXUS
An anomaly. It will be monitored.

!Nexus tugs gently on the leash, and Axl is led away from the park.

But his eyes stay on Ella until she's completely gone.

Something in him has awakened. Something dangerous.

Something undefined.
