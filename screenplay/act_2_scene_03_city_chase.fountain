EXT. ANDROID CITY - ALLEYWAYS - LATER

Axl moves through a maze of service corridors and maintenance spaces between buildings. It's a part of the city designed for androids and machines, not humans.

Everything is cold and functional. No soft edges. No safety measures for flesh and blood.

He scrapes his arms on metal. His feet hurt from running barefoot on cold steel.

Behind him, distant alarms. The whine of enforcer units being activated.

He doesn't look back.

He just runs.
