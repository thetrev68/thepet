INT. HABITAT - AFTERNOON

The clock reads 1355 hours.

Axl sits on his bed, perfectly still. His hands are folded in his lap. He looks calm. Compliant.

But his eyes are alert. Waiting.

Nexus stands at the glass wall, monitoring him. Recording baseline metrics before the specialist arrives.

NEXUS
A doctor... comes. You talk with them. You be... good. Okay?

AXL
Yes, Nesses.

His voice is flat. Obedient. Exactly what Nexus expects to hear.

Nexus seems satisfied by this response.

NEXUS
I... like you. I... hope you stay... same. Good.

It's almost affectionate. Almost genuinely sad, if androids could be sad.

Axl feels something like guilt.

But he pushes it away.

A soft CHIME at the entrance to the residential unit.

The specialist has arrived.

Nexus turns from the glass and moves toward the door to greet them. This is protocol. This is what Nexus must do.

For the first time since Axl has known him, Nexus's attention is not on Axl.

Axl waits. Counting seconds in his head.

Five seconds. Ten.

He hears voices in the other room. Nexus and another android, conversing. Technical language. Reports.

Twenty seconds.

Axl moves.

He stands and walks to the small table where his meal was left. The bowl is still there, mostly untouched.

He picks it up and hurls it at the glass wall.

It doesn't break. The material is too strong. But it CRACKS slightly, and makes a sound—a sharp, loud CLANG that echoes through the habitat.

He hears Nexus's voice cut off mid-sentence in the other room.

NEXUS (O.S.)
What was that?

Axl doesn't wait for a response. He moves to the pet door—the small reinforced opening where his meals are delivered.

He grabs the edge and pulls.

It doesn't budge. It's locked, as always.

He looks around frantically and spots something he's been waiting for—a sharp corner of the broken bowl.

He wedges it into the locking mechanism and TWISTS.

SPARKS FLY.

The lock HISSES and SHORTS OUT.

An ALARM BEEPS—soft, but insistent.

NEXUS (O.S.)
Axl!

Footsteps. Fast. Nexus is coming.

Axl throws his full body weight against the pet door.

The damaged lock gives way. The door SLIDES OPEN, stuck halfway, but open enough.

Axl squeezes through the gap, scraping his shoulder as he goes.
