EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - FORAGING AREA - DAY

The strays move through a ruined structure overgrown with vines and plant growth. The android city doesn't extend here. This is wildness that the androids have abandoned as unsalvageable.

It's actually teeming with life.

Ella leads Axl and the younger strays through the space.

ELLA
Here. See?

!She points to clusters of mushrooms growing in the damp shadow.

ELLA
Dark spots. Good. White spots: poison.

!She picks a dark-spotted one and hands it to Axl. He takes it carefully, studying it.

ELLA
You have to learn this. The difference between food and death. The androids did that thinking for you. Now you do it.

!She finds more mushrooms, showing him the difference.

Axl picks one, slowly, carefully, second-guessing himself.

ELLA
Good.

!It's not effusive praise. It's just acknowledgment. But it means something.

They move deeper. Finn finds a cache of canned goods, half-buried.

FINN
Look! Look!

DARA
(sharp)
Quiet.

!Finn falls silent immediately. Dara opens one of the cans carefully, sniffs it.

She nods. Good.

Axl watches this silent communication. This hierarchy of survival. Dara is young but clearly trusted with responsibility. The younger strays defer to her and to Ella and Koss.

ELLA
(to Axl)
You understand? Noise brings attention. Attention brings enforcers.

AXL
We hide from androids?

ELLA
We live around them. They don't understand spaces like this. They're built for the city. For chrome and order. They can't navigate chaos.

!She hands Axl a canvas bag.

ELLA
Fill it. We need three bags before dark.

!Axl takes the bag and starts gathering: mushrooms, some edible roots Ella points out, a handful of insects. He grimaces at the insects but takes them.

As they work, Dara watches Axl struggle with a particularly stubborn root.

DARA
How long before he's actually useful?

ELLA
He's already useful. He just doesn't know it yet.

!Axl hears this. Something shifts in his expression.
