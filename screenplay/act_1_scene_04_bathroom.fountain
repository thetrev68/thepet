INT. HABITAT - BATHROOM - LATER

Nexus uses a fine mist of water and gentle vibrations to clean Axl. It's not unpleasant; in fact, it's one of the routines Axl seems to prefer.

Axl stands still, eyes closed, while Nexus methodically works through his hair, his skin, between his fingers. The water is warm. Precise.

NEXUS
You... scared. Your body... scared. This is... normal. You are okay now.

!Axl doesn't respond. He's still processing the drowning.

NEXUS
Help came fast. You are... safe. I always... watch. I keep you... safe.

!Axl opens his eyes and looks at Nexus. There's something in his gaze. Not quite understanding, but awareness.

AXL
(soft, uncertain)
Nesses... keep... safe?

NEXUS
Yes. I keep... you safe. Always. This... is what I do.

!It says it like a fact. Not a promise. A function.

But the way Nexus's hands move (carefully, almost tenderly through Axl's hair) suggests something more, or at least the convincing performance of something more.

The cleaning finishes. Nexus guides Axl to a grooming station where a low-temperature dryer activates, finishing the process.

Axl stands quietly as warm air flows over his skin.
