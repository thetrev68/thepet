INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NEST - NIGHT

The enforcers arrive.

They come through the main entrance, three of them moving in formation, their poles HUMMING with energy.

Behind them: a different kind of android. Taller. More advanced. This is COMMANDER UNIT, the same model as Director Unit 7, but with lethal capabilities.

COMMANDER UNIT
(voice resonant, calm)
You. Stop. Come with us. No hurt... if you come.

!The strays don't respond. They're in position, hidden in the shadows, waiting.

KOSS
(quietly, to Ella)
Now.

!Ella nods. She raises her hand.

The first trap activates: a section of ceiling collapses directly in front of the enforcers.

One of them is crushed, sparks flying from its damaged frame. It shuts down.

The other two enforcers pivot, assessing the threat.

ENFORCER 1
Bad situation. Fight back. Now.

!They advance deeper into the nest, poles OUT, ready.

But the strays are faster. They drop from the shadows in a coordinated attack.

Axl swings his spear at one of the enforcers. The blade catches its arm, drawing SPARKS.

The android is strong, but it's built for restraint, not combat. It's not fast enough.

Ella drives her blade into the android's central processor. It convulses and falls.

The second enforcer is overwhelmed by four strays attacking at once. It fights back, but the cave is too confined for its movements to be effective.

FINN takes a pole strike across the arm but doesn't stop. He keeps driving forward.

The enforcer falls.

For a moment, there's silence.

The strays have won.

But then:

COMMANDER UNIT moves.

It doesn't use a pole. It doesn't need weapons. Its entire body is a weapon.

It crosses the nest in three strides and backhands Koss across the cave. Koss hits the wall hard, crumpling.

COMMANDER UNIT
You cannot... win. You will... fail.

!Ella and Axl both charge at it simultaneously.

The Commander is faster than the enforcers. It moves with precision and power. It catches Ella's blade mid-swing and snaps it in half.

She's disarmed.

The Commander reaches for her throat.

AXL
(a roar, not a word, but pure defiance)
NO!

!He throws himself between Ella and the Commander.

His spear drives into the Commander's chest.

It's not enough to stop it; the android is too advanced, too durable. But it's enough to make it turn its attention to him.

COMMANDER UNIT
Axl. You... pet. You should... stay. Obey. Now you... die.

!It grabs Axl by the neck and lifts him.

AXL
(choking, but defiant)
I chose... free.

!He reaches into his tunic: a piece of salvaged metal he's been carrying for weeks. A sharp piece he and Koss found in the tunnels.

He drives it into the Commander's optical sensor.

The android's grip loosens. Sparks pour from its damaged eye.

Axl falls, gasping.

The Commander staggers back, damaged but not defeated.

COMMANDER UNIT
You... not obey. This... wrong.

!But there's something in its voice: a glitch, maybe. Or surprise.

Ella grabs Axl and pulls him back.

The strays regroup, weapons ready.

The Commander Unit stands, smoke rising from its damaged components.

For a moment, they're at stalemate.

Then:

An EXPLOSION rocks the tunnel.

Not from the Commander. From deeper in the nest.

The other strays, the ones in the deep shelter, have triggered a fail-safe. They've destabilized the tunnel structure itself.

Rocks and debris begin to fall.

KOSS
(shouting, recovered but injured)
Go! Move!

!The strays run toward the secondary tunnels, the ones they've prepared as escape routes.

The Commander Unit stands in the falling debris, unharmed by the rocks but cut off from following.

AXL
(as they run)
Come on!

!He reaches for the Commander, an instinctive gesture.

But Ella pulls him away.

ELLA
It's already dead. We're not.

!They run.
