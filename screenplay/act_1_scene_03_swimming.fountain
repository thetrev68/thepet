INT. SWIMMING FACILITY - POOL AREA - LATER

A large, clean, temperature-controlled pool. Crystal clear water. Very sterile. Very safe.

The edges are soft, rounded. No sharp corners. Designed for safety and control.

Nexus stands at the pool's edge, perfectly still. It doesn't enter the water. Androids and water don't mix well; it's a design limitation.

Axl wades in, then begins to swim. His strokes are competent but not graceful. Functional.

He swims back and forth, lap after lap. Nexus watches, recording metrics.

On the wall, a TIMER counts down the session.

Axl swims mechanically. Back and forth. Back and forth.

Then, on one of his laps, something shifts.

He's past the middle of the pool. The water here is deeper. Still safe, but deep enough that his feet can't touch.

He glances at Nexus.

And then something in him sparks. Not defiance, exactly. Just... curiosity.

He swims deeper. Toward the far end, where the pool slopes slightly.

NEXUS
Axl. Stop. Come back. Stay... in pattern.

!Axl hesitates. He's never disobeyed before. But this pull, this want, it's new.

He ducks underwater.

For a moment, he's in silence. His hair floats. His lungs burn slightly.

It's different. It's alive.

He surfaces and keeps swimming.

NEXUS
Axl. Do not... go there. Come back... now.

!There's something in Nexus's voice now. Not alarm, but something closer to concern. Or the simulation of it.

Axl swims further. He's having... fun? Is that what this is?

Then reality hits. His feet reach down instinctively and find nothing.

The pool floor is gone. He's suspended in the open water, far from the edge.

For a moment, it's exhilarating. Then the weight of it crashes down.

He realizes how far he is from safety. How deep. How alone.

Panic blooms in his chest. His exhilaration flips, becomes terror.

He thrashes. His lungs scream. The water that was beautiful is now suffocating.

He tries to touch bottom, but there's nothing. No ground. No anchor.

Panic floods his brain. He can't breathe. He can't...

NEXUS
stands at the edge, perfectly still.

It cannot enter the water.

But its voice cuts through the sound of water:

NEXUS
Axl. Breathe. Help... comes. Help is here.

!Axl hears this but can't process it. He's drowning.

He flails harder. His vision darkens.

Then a FIGURE dives into the pool.

Not Nexus.

A DIFFERENT ANDROID. Sleeker, more streamlined. Built for this.

A LIFEGUARD ANDROID surfaces next to Axl in seconds. It's efficient, practiced.

It grabs Axl firmly and hauls him to the shallow end in one powerful motion.

Axl coughs, gasping, his whole body shaking with fear and shock.

The lifeguard places him gently on the pool deck, still checking his vital signs.

LIFEGUARD ANDROID
(to Nexus, not to Axl)
Subject is stable. Minor water aspiration. Full recovery expected.

!Nexus approaches Axl. It kneels, an unusual gesture.

NEXUS
You... broke the rules. This is... bad. But you are... okay.

!But then (and this is subtle) Nexus places one smooth hand on Axl's chest, over his heart.

NEXUS
I... fixed it. You will be... safe now. No more... accident.

!Is it comfort? Or control?

Axl, still gasping, looks up at Nexus.

For the first time, something like emotion crosses his face. Not quite fear. Fear of losing Nexus? Fear of the water? Or fear of something he can't name?

He makes a small, fragile sound:

AXL
(whispered)
Nesses...

NEXUS
I am here. You are safe now.

!And it's the closest thing to affection Nexus has shown, delivered in exactly the right tone, at exactly the right moment, to make Axl feel held rather than controlled.

Axl leans into it.

The lifeguard android stands silently, waiting for further instructions.
