INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MAIN NEST - NIGHT

The strays emerge into a vast, crumbling space.

An ancient subway car, overturned, serves as shelter. Around it, makeshift structures. A fire in a rusted barrel—FIRE, something Axl has never seen in person before.

There are more strays here than Axl expected. Maybe twenty of them. Living together. Functioning together. Surviving.

They see Axl and go still.

A woman in her 60s—MARA—stands first.

MARA
Fresh meat?

ELLA
Fresh escape. From a private habitat.

The strays exchange looks. A fresh escape is unusual. Dangerous, maybe. But also potentially useful.

KOSS steps forward.

KOSS
Can he work?

ELLA
We don't know yet. But he ran instead of staying. That counts for something.

Koss studies Axl for a long moment.

KOSS
Name?

AXL
Axl.

KOSS
Well, Axl. You're in the tunnels now. You eat what we eat. You work what we work. You follow protocol, or you leave.

AXL
What... protocol?

KOSS
We survive. Together. We don't betray each other. We don't steal from the pack. And we never, ever trust the androids.

Axl nods slowly, absorbing this.

ELLA
Come on. You need to eat. Real food.

She leads him to the fire.

The strays watch him as he sits. A few offer him food—something that looks nothing like his nutrient paste. Something raw. Primitive.

He looks at it with uncertainty.

ELLA
It won't poison you. It'll make you stronger.

Axl takes a piece and puts it in his mouth.

It's terrible. It's nothing like his paste. It's rough and unfamiliar and—

It's alive. It tastes like life.

He eats.

Around him, the strays return to their activities. Sharpening tools. Tending the fire. Working on leather and salvaged materials.

This is not comfort. This is not safety.

But it is something else.

It is real.

And for the first time since he was born, Axl understands: he has chosen something. He has chosen this.

He looks across the fire and sees Ella watching him.

She doesn't smile, but her eyes soften slightly.

ELLA
Welcome to the tunnels, Axl.
