INT. HABITAT - LATER

The morning stretches on.

Axl goes through the motions. Exercise. Grooming. The routines that have defined his entire life.

But everything feels different now.

He watches Nexus with new eyes.

The android that he loved, that he was proud of, suddenly reveals its true nature: a jailer. A perfect, programmed jailer that will eventually decide he's no longer worth keeping.

Nexus notices this shift.

NEXUS
Your emotional state has changed. You are displaying signs of acceptance and resignation. This is good. The specialist will see that you are cooperative.

!Axl nods, because that's what he's trained to do.

But inside, something is breaking.

And in that breaking, something else is being born.

Something wild.

Something desperate.

Something that remembers Ella's face, defiant and alive, even as the enforcers took her.

The clock on the wall counts down to 1400 hours.

Axl watches the minutes pass.

And he begins to understand: he has nothing left to lose.
