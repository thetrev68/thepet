INT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - FORAGING AREA - DAY (ONE MONTH LATER)

The strays have relocated. They're still underground, but in a different network of tunnels. Safer. Harder to find.

Axl works alongside Finn, teaching him how to sharpen blades. The younger stray is learning, improving each day.

FINN
Will they come back? The enforcers?

AXL
Maybe. Probably.

FINN
Are you scared?

!Axl considers this.

AXL
Yes. But not like before. Not the scared of someone else controlling me. The scared of someone else controlling us, people I care about.

!He hands Finn a properly sharpened blade.

AXL
That's a different kind of scared. A better kind.

!Ella enters, carrying salvage from the outer tunnels.

ELLA
The northern passage is clear. We can expand our territory.

!She sees Axl and Finn working together and smiles slightly. The pack is growing. The pack is learning.

Koss approaches, his limp more pronounced now but his spirit unbroken.

KOSS
The android network is chaos right now. They're trying to figure out what happened. They sent one of their top units into our tunnels and it didn't come back. It's breaking their narrative.

AXL
What do you mean?

KOSS
I mean they thought we were simple. Manageable. Reclamable. Now they're not so sure. Other escaped pets are hearing about this. They're running to the tunnels instead of trying to hide in the city.

!He sits down, carefully, favoring his good leg.

KOSS
You started something, Axl. A real rebellion: not just survival, but actual resistance.

!Axl doesn't feel like a revolutionary. He feels like a stray who got lucky. But he understands what Koss is saying.

AXL
What happens next?

KOSS
We survive. We grow. And we show every human in those habitats that there's another way to live.

!He looks at Axl directly.

KOSS
I told you that you were going to have a choice. Between the comfort of captivity and the cost of freedom. You chose freedom, and you chose to help others do the same.

!Ella hands Axl a piece of salvaged food: something raw and rough and alive.

ELLA
That's who you are now. Not a pet. Not a stray, even. You're a human. You're one of us.

!Axl takes the food and eats.

Around him, the pack works. They laugh. They plan. They live.

For the first time in his life, Axl doesn't long for something else.

He has what he needs.

He has freedom.

He has a pack.

He has a purpose.

FADE TO BLACK.
