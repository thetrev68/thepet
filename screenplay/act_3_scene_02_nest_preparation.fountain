INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - VARIOUS - DAY

The nest transforms.

Axl works alongside FINN and other strays, hauling salvaged materials. They're building barriers. Creating choke points. Setting traps that androids—with their computational thinking—won't anticipate.

Koss directs the construction with precision.

KOSS
Here. This corner. We collapse the ceiling when they pass. The weight will damage their processors.

!Maya sharpens weapons—crude spears, blades made from salvaged metal. Ella teaches the strays who've never fought before how to use them.

Axl practices with his spear. The weapon that was made for him now feels like an extension of his body.

Three days pass. The nest becomes a fortress.

Then—

A scout returns. One of the strays who watches the outer passages.

SCOUT
They're coming. Big force. Three enforcer units. A command android.

!The nest goes still.

KOSS
How long?

SCOUT
An hour. Maybe less.

!Koss nods to Maya. She rounds up the youngest and the elders. They move toward the deep shelter.

Mara puts her hand on Axl's shoulder as she passes.

MARA
You stay alive. You hear me? You stay alive, because you're one of us now, and we don't lose our own.

!Then she's gone, disappearing into the depths with the others.

The remaining strays—maybe fifteen of them, capable of fighting—gather around Koss.

KOSS
This is it. We stop them here, or we run forever. I know what I'd rather do.

!He looks at each face. Ella. Axl. The others.

KOSS
Any of you want to leave, go now. I won't judge you.

!No one moves.

KOSS
Then we fight like we own this place. Because we do.
