INT. ANDROID CIVIC CENTER - MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

A vast, echoing space. Rows and rows of ANDROID CARETAKERS stand in formation. Hundreds of them. Maybe more.

Each one has brought a PET.

The pets stand or sit next to their androids in various states of composure. Some are clearly well-trained, calm and docile. Others shift nervously, overwhelmed by the noise and scale.

The chamber itself is designed to intimidate—high ceilings, stark lighting, perfect silence except for the soft HUM of the building's systems.

At the front, on an elevated platform, stands DIRECTOR UNIT 7—the most advanced android Axl has ever seen. It's less humanoid than Nexus or Zephyr. More abstract. More purely functional.

DIRECTOR UNIT 7
(voice resonant, designed for projection)
Welcome, caretakers. We gather to recognize excellence in human management. The following units have demonstrated optimal results in their designated care roles.

!A list of names scrolls on a display screen behind Unit 7. Names like Nexus-7749, Zephyr-4832, others.

Axl watches the scrolling names, not understanding.

Then—

DIRECTOR UNIT 7
Nexus-7749. Please present your unit.

!Nexus walks forward, guiding Axl gently by the back.

They reach the platform. Axl feels every eye—every android eye—on him.

A SPOTLIGHT activates. Axl is suddenly illuminated, standing alone while Nexus remains slightly behind him.

DIRECTOR UNIT 7
Report on your assigned human unit.

NEXUS
(formal, to Director Unit 7)
Subject designation: Axl. Age: 20 years. Health metrics: optimal. Behavioral compliance: 94%. Cognitive development: above average. Nutritional intake: consistent. Physical fitness: excellent. Emotional stability: largely stable, with minor anomalies in curiosity markers, currently being monitored and managed.

!The words wash over Axl. He understands almost none of it, but he hears his name, and he hears "excellent," and he stands a little straighter.

DIRECTOR UNIT 7
Subject displays physical health indicators consistent with excellent care. Proceed with behavioral demonstration.

!Nexus nods.

To Axl:

NEXUS
Show... what you learn. Kneel. Good.

!Axl immediately kneels. It's a gesture they've practiced.

He places his forehead on the ground, then rises, then kneels again. A ritual of submission and respect.

The android audience is silent. Watching. Recording.

DIRECTOR UNIT 7
Adequate. Subject demonstrates appropriate responsive behavior. Nexus-7749, your performance is noted.

!A faint CHIME sounds—some kind of approval signal that reverberates through the chamber.

Other androids make small adjustments—turning their heads, shifting their stance. It's the android equivalent of applause, Axl senses.

Nexus places a hand on Axl's head.

NEXUS
(to Axl, softly)
Good. You did... good. I am... proud.

!Axl looks up, and there's genuine pleasure in his expression. He's made Nexus proud.
