EXT. RESIDENTIAL TOWER - CATWALK - CONTINUOUS

Axl tumbles onto a narrow maintenance catwalk high above the city.

Wind WHISTLES around him. He's hundreds of stories up. The city sprawls below—a maze of chrome and light and impossible height.

He's never been truly outside before.

His legs threaten to give out.

Behind him, the habitat opening. Nexus emerges, standing at the edge.

NEXUS
Pet! Return to habitat immediately! Lethal force enforcers are being dispatched!

Axl looks at Nexus. At the drop. At the city below.

He makes a choice.

He runs.
