INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NEST - EARLY MORNING

Axl wakes to find the nest in unusual activity. Koss is organizing the able-bodied strays. Maya is checking their salvaged weapons. Ella is going through a map—an actual paper map of the tunnels, marked with routes and dangers.

AXL
(approaching)
What's happening?

ELLA
The northern market tunnel. We're going in today. Koss thinks there's medicine and supplies we can salvage.

AXL
How long?

ELLA
Maybe a full day. Could be more if we find a cache.

KOSS
(to the group)
Standard protocols. Scouts first. Never trust what the androids have abandoned. Could be traps.

He looks directly at Axl.

KOSS
You're coming with us. Time to see what real survival looks like.

Axl nods. This is a test, he understands. A chance to prove himself.
