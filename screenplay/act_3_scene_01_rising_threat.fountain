INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NEST - NIGHT

Weeks have passed. Axl has been with the strays long enough that the others barely remember him as a pet anymore. He moves like them. He speaks like them. He thinks like them.

But something is changing in the tunnels. The raids are becoming more frequent. The enforcers are searching more deliberately.

The pack is gathered around the fire, and the mood is tense.

KOSS
They know we're here. They're narrowing the search perimeter. We've got maybe two weeks before they close in completely.

MAYA
We could move. We've done it before.

KOSS
Move where? They're monitoring all the major tunnel systems. The northern passages are flooded. The eastern routes are caved in.

He pauses, letting the weight of this settle.

KOSS
We're trapped.

ELLA
Then we fight.

Everyone goes quiet. Fighting the enforcers isn't something the strays do. They hide. They survive. They don't confront.

MARA
(old, tired)
Fighting means death. They're machines. We're flesh.

ELLA
We're smarter. We know these tunnels. We know how to use what we have.

She looks directly at Axl.

ELLA
And we've got nothing left to lose.

The strays look at each other. The logic is inexorable. They can run until they can't. Or they can stand.

KOSS
(after a long moment)
If we're going to do this, we do it right. We use the tunnels. We use our knowledge of this space. We set traps. We make them come to us.

He stands, taking command.

KOSS
Everyone who can fight, we prepare. Everyone else—the old, the very young—we move them to the deep shelter. That's non-negotiable.

MARA nods, accepting this. She begins organizing the youngest strays.

Axl looks at Ella.

AXL
What do we do?

ELLA
We prepare.
