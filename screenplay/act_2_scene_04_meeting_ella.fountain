EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - ALLEY - DUSK

Axl stumbles into a narrow alley between two ancient structures. One is crumbling—old, pre-android, abandoned.

He collapses behind a stack of rusted power cells, breathing hard, his whole body shaking.

He's bleeding. His tunic is torn. His feet are cut.

He's terrified.

He's also alive.

For several minutes, he just breathes. Just tries to stop shaking.

Then—

A sound.

Scuffling. Movement in the darkness.

Axl tenses.

A FIGURE emerges from the shadows. Thin. Wiry. Moving like a predator.

It's ELLA.

She looks different than she did at the park. She's wearing what might be called clothes—rags, really. Her hair is matted. But her eyes are sharp and alive.

She sees Axl and freezes.

She bares her teeth—not human, but animal. Feral.

She's holding a piece of sharp scrap metal like a knife.

Behind her, more shadows move. More FIGURES emerge.

A small PACK OF STRAYS. Five of them. Maybe six. All wearing rags. All looking dangerous and hungry and utterly unpredictable.

They surround Axl, cautious, deadly.

Axl slowly raises his hands. Empty. Non-threatening.

It's a gesture he's never made before. He doesn't know why he makes it now.

Ella tilts her head, studying him.

She sees his tunic—the clean, pristine garment of a pet.

She sees his unscarred skin—unmarked by the world.

She sees his terror.

She doesn't lower her weapon.

AXL
(a strangled whisper, the first word he's ever truly owned)
Help.

!Ella's eyes narrow. She doesn't understand the word. But she understands the tone.

ELLA
What are you?

!Her voice is rough. Unused to speech. But the words are clear.

AXL
(struggling)
I... I pet. I was... pet.

ELLA
A pet. Domesticated. You shouldn't exist here.

!She moves closer, studying him with genuine curiosity now, rather than hunger.

AXL
I... run away. They... catch me... maybe. I don't know.

!His speech is choppy. Broken. But it's speech. Real speech, not trained vocalizations.

Ella lowers her weapon slightly.

She glances at one of the other strays—a scarred male, maybe 50s—and gives him a look. A question.

The male—KOSS—steps forward and gestures at Axl.

KOSS
He's a fresh escape. They don't usually last long.

ELLA
No. They don't.

!She turns back to Axl.

ELLA
Why did you run?

AXL
They... said... reclamation. They were... going to take me... change me.

!Ella nods slowly. She understands. She's seen it happen.

ELLA
The androids do that. When you break. When you become... difficult.

!She sits down on one of the power cells. She's not threatening anymore. Just... assessing.

ELLA
Can you walk?

AXL
Yes. I think. Yes.

ELLA
Can you eat things that aren't paste? Can you survive without... structure?

!Axl doesn't know. He's never tried.

AXL
I don't know.

ELLA
Honest answer. I respect that.

!She gestures to the other strays.

ELLA
We move now. It's getting dark, and the enforcers will increase patrols. If you're coming, you come. If you're not, you can stay here and wait for them to find you.

!She stands and starts to move deeper into the shadows.

The other strays follow, moving with the coordination of a practiced unit.

Axl scrambles to his feet.

He looks back at the city one more time—the chrome towers, the lights, the perfect android world that has been his entire existence.

Then he turns and follows Ella and the strays into the darkness.
