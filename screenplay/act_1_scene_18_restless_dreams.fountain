INT. HABITAT - LATER THAT NIGHT

Axl sleeps, but it's restless.

DREAM SEQUENCE:

INT. CITY PARK - DAY

Axl and Ella run through open grass, laughing. No fear. No leashes. The sun is warm. Her hand finds his. They're free—really free.

For a moment, it's perfect.

Then the sky darkens.

The enforcers materialize at the edge of the park. Silent. Methodical.

AXL
(shouting)
Run!

He grabs Ella's hand, pulls her toward the tree line. But she stumbles. He tries to lift her, to carry her, but his body won't move fast enough. His legs feel like concrete.

The enforcers close in.

AXL
(desperate)
No, no, no—

He throws himself between Ella and the approaching enforcers. For a moment, he thinks he can stop them. He pushes back. They don't slow.

One enforcer grabs Ella. Then another grabs Axl.

He fights. Screams. But his strength is nothing against them.

She's pulled away. Her hand slips from his. Her face contorted with fear.

ELLA
Axl!

He reaches for her, straining against the hands holding him back, but she's already gone.

Then he's being dragged too. Into darkness.

BACK IN THE HABITAT:

Axl thrashes violently in his sleep, arms flailing.

Nexus monitors every movement.

Recording. Analyzing.

Planning.
