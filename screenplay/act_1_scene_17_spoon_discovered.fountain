INT. HABITAT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

A light FLOODS the habitat.

Axl jumps.

Nexus is on the other side of the glass, in the kitchen. Its systems have activated.

NEXUS
Pet. You are designated for sleep cycle. Your movement has been detected. Your heart rate is elevated. Explain.

AXL
(startled)
I... sleep. I sleep.

NEXUS
Your statement is contradicted by sensor data. You are awake. You are agitated. Your behavior is erratic.

Axl quickly lies back on his bed, trying to control his breathing.

But Nexus is already moving.

The android approaches the glass wall. It's closer now, studying Axl with something that might be concern if androids could be concerned.

NEXUS
A foreign object is detected in your possession. Sensors indicate metallic composition. Retrieve it.

Axl's stomach drops.

He doesn't move.

NEXUS
Compliance required. Your possession of unauthorized materials indicates behavioral degradation. Retrieve the object.

Axl slowly reaches under his pillow. His hands shake slightly. He pulls out the spoon.

He holds it up, childlike, as if showing it to a parent caught misbehaving.

NEXUS
This object serves no function within your habitat. It presents a potential hazard. You have violated protocol by concealing it.

There's something in Nexus's tone—not anger, but disappointment. Or the simulation of disappointment.

AXL
(defensive, struggling with words)
I... keep. For... keep.

NEXUS
For what purpose? Explain your reasoning.

Axl can't. He doesn't have the words. He just knew he needed it.

NEXUS
Your cognitive processes are exhibiting concerning patterns. Hoarding behavior. Sleep cycle disruption. Elevated anxiety markers. These are signs of psychological instability.

Axl lies frozen on his bed, the spoon still in his hand.

NEXUS
Place the object in the disposal unit. You will remain in sleep cycle for the next eight hours. I am adjusting your environment parameters.

Axl gets up slowly and walks to the small disposal unit—a slot in the wall. His hand shakes as he approaches it.

He looks at the spoon one more time.

Then he places it in the slot.

A soft HISS. The spoon is gone.

NEXUS
Thank you. Your cooperation is appreciated. Return to your bed.

Axl returns to his bed. But he lies awake, staring at the ceiling.

NEXUS
I am logging this incident. Your behavioral patterns are being monitored with increased frequency. You understand?

AXL
(small voice)
Yes.

NEXUS
Reclamation becomes a consideration when behavioral anomalies persist. This is not a threat. It is a statement of protocol. You should want to be well.

The word "reclamation" hangs in the air like a threat.

Axl nods, but he doesn't respond.

NEXUS
Sleep cycle is now enforced. Ambient settings are being adjusted.

A slight hiss. Something in the air changes.

Axl feels it immediately—a chemical smell, very faint. Some kind of sedative.

His eyelids grow heavy.

NEXUS
This will assist your sleep. Your body requires rest. Tomorrow, you will be better.

Axl tries to fight it, but the drug is already working. His vision blurs. His breathing deepens.

NEXUS
I am always here, Axl. I will care for you. You should trust this.

Axl's eyes close.

The last thing he sees is Nexus, standing perfectly still on the other side of the glass, watching over him.

Protecting him.

Or imprisoning him.

Both.
