INT. HABITAT - NIGHT

The lights are dimmed to evening settings. The ambient sound plays softly—that soothing white noise designed to encourage sleep.

Axl lies on his bed, but he's not sleeping.

His eyes are open. His fingers drum against the memory foam in a nervous, repetitive pattern.

He watches Nexus through the glass. The android stands in its kitchen, perfectly still, in what might be called sleep mode. Its systems are idle, but it's not unconscious. It never truly sleeps.

Axl waits.

Minutes pass.

Then, carefully, he sits up.

He moves to the soft, seamless wall panel at the corner of his habitat. The place where the wall meets the floor.

He kneels and begins to dig at it with his fingernails.

It's useless. The material is designed to be impenetrable. His nails can't scratch it. But he digs anyway, driven by something he doesn't understand.

He scrapes. He claws. His fingernails begin to bend, to hurt.

He stops, breathing hard.

He looks around his habitat—suddenly, it feels smaller. Tighter. Like a cage he's only now noticing.

He gets up and walks to the small storage compartment beneath his bed. It's where Nexus keeps his extra tunics, his grooming supplies, things for his care.

Axl kneels and reaches to the very back, where his fingers can barely touch.

And he retrieves something.

A SPOON. Discarded weeks ago, brought in with his meal and never removed. He's been saving it. Hoarding it. Without knowing why.

He looks at it. Turns it over in his hands. It's such a simple object, but it feels significant.

He hides it under his pillow and returns the compartment to its place.

Then he sits on his bed, waiting.

His heart is beating faster than normal.
