INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NEST - NIGHT

The pack gathers around the fire. They're eating. The mood is communal. Quiet contentment.

Axl sits between Ella and Koss. His body aches. His feet throb. But he's present.

An old female stray—MARA—is teaching two younger ones how to tan leather using salvaged materials. Another group is sorting through salvaged electronics, looking for usable parts.

This is not chaos. It's a functioning society.

Koss speaks quietly, just to Axl.

KOSS
The blade you worked on yesterday. We used it to cut hide today. Clean cut.

!It's praise. Understated, but praise.

AXL
(hesitantly)
Good?

KOSS
More than good. It'll hold.

!Axl nods. He looks at his hands. Calloused now. Scarred. Nothing like the soft, maintained hands of a pet.

Ella is nearby, working on something—wrapping plant fibers around a wooden handle.

She catches Axl watching her. She doesn't smile, but her eyes soften slightly.

There's an understanding forming between them. Not romantic, not yet. But something like respect. Something like partnership.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - AXL'S CORNER - NIGHT

The nest has grown. More makeshift shelters. Better organization. A smoking area for the fire. Storage sections for salvaged materials.

Axl has a small sleeping area now. Nothing like his habitat. But it's his. He's arranged salvaged blankets. A few objects he's collected.

Ella approaches. She holds out the wrapped tool she was working on—a spear, now complete. The handle is sturdy. The blade is one Axl helped sharpen.

ELLA
This one's yours.

!Axl takes it. It's rough, imperfect, but it's been made with care.

AXL
For me?

ELLA
For the pack. But... yes. For you.

!They stand in silence for a moment. Axl runs his thumb over the wrapping.

AXL
I didn't know how to make anything before.

ELLA
You didn't know a lot of things.

AXL
I still don't.

ELLA
You will.

!She sits down on the edge of his sleeping area. Close, but not touching.

ELLA
The first week, I thought you'd slow us down. Get us caught.

AXL
I almost did.

ELLA
Yes. But you didn't. And you didn't run back to your owner when it got hard.

AXL
Could I have? Run back?

ELLA
No. Unit 7 would have recycled you. Too much trouble now. You're not a pet anymore.

!She says it like a fact. But there's something else underneath—relief, maybe. Or acceptance.

AXL
I don't know how to be anything else.

ELLA
Then you learn. Like the blade. Slow. Wrong sometimes. Then better.

!Axl looks at the spear in his hands. Then at Ella.

AXL
Thank you.

!Ella stands. She's not comfortable with gratitude yet. Neither of them are.

ELLA
Tomorrow, we scout the old market. Northern tunnel. Koss thinks there's medicine storage.

AXL
I'll be ready.

!She nods and walks back toward the fire.

Axl sits alone with the spear. He turns it over in his hands. He tries to imagine Nexus's reaction to this object. This crude, handmade thing.

Nexus would have it sanitized. Filed. Made efficient.

But Axl doesn't want that anymore.

He holds the spear to his chest and closes his eyes.

For the first time in his life, he owns something that's imperfect. And it's beautiful because it's imperfect.
