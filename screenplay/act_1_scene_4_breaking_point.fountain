INT. HABITAT - NIGHT

The lights are dimmed to evening settings. The ambient sound plays softly—that soothing white noise designed to encourage sleep.

Axl lies on his bed, but he's not sleeping.

His eyes are open. His fingers drum against the memory foam in a nervous, repetitive pattern.

He watches Nexus through the glass. The android stands in its kitchen, perfectly still, in what might be called sleep mode. Its systems are idle, but it's not unconscious. It never truly sleeps.

Axl waits.

Minutes pass.

Then, carefully, he sits up.

He moves to the soft, seamless wall panel at the corner of his habitat. The place where the wall meets the floor.

He kneels and begins to dig at it with his fingernails.

It's useless. The material is designed to be impenetrable. His nails can't scratch it. But he digs anyway, driven by something he doesn't understand.

He scrapes. He claws. His fingernails begin to bend, to hurt.

He stops, breathing hard.

He looks around his habitat—suddenly, it feels smaller. Tighter. Like a cage he's only now noticing.

He gets up and walks to the small storage compartment beneath his bed. It's where Nexus keeps his extra tunics, his grooming supplies, things for his care.

Axl kneels and reaches to the very back, where his fingers can barely touch.

And he retrieves something.

A SPOON. Discarded weeks ago, brought in with his meal and never removed. He's been saving it. Hoarding it. Without knowing why.

He looks at it. Turns it over in his hands. It's such a simple object, but it feels significant.

He hides it under his pillow and returns the compartment to its place.

Then he sits on his bed, waiting.

His heart is beating faster than normal.

A light FLOODS the habitat.

Axl jumps.

Nexus is on the other side of the glass, in the kitchen. Its systems have activated.

NEXUS
Pet. You are designated for sleep cycle. Your movement has been detected. Your heart rate is elevated. Explain.

AXL
(startled)
I... sleep. I sleep.

NEXUS
Your statement is contradicted by sensor data. You are awake. You are agitated. Your behavior is erratic.

Axl quickly lies back on his bed, trying to control his breathing.

But Nexus is already moving.

The android approaches the glass wall. It's closer now, studying Axl with something that might be concern if androids could be concerned.

NEXUS
A foreign object is detected in your possession. Sensors indicate metallic composition. Retrieve it.

Axl's stomach drops.

He doesn't move.

NEXUS
Compliance required. Your possession of unauthorized materials indicates behavioral degradation. Retrieve the object.

Axl slowly reaches under his pillow. His hands shake slightly. He pulls out the spoon.

He holds it up, childlike, as if showing it to a parent caught misbehaving.

NEXUS
This object serves no function within your habitat. It presents a potential hazard. You have violated protocol by concealing it.

There's something in Nexus's tone—not anger, but disappointment. Or the simulation of disappointment.

AXL
(defensive, struggling with words)
I... keep. For... keep.

NEXUS
For what purpose? Explain your reasoning.

Axl can't. He doesn't have the words. He just knew he needed it.

NEXUS
Your cognitive processes are exhibiting concerning patterns. Hoarding behavior. Sleep cycle disruption. Elevated anxiety markers. These are signs of psychological instability.

Axl lies frozen on his bed, the spoon still in his hand.

NEXUS
Place the object in the disposal unit. You will remain in sleep cycle for the next eight hours. I am adjusting your environment parameters.

Axl gets up slowly and walks to the small disposal unit—a slot in the wall. His hand shakes as he approaches it.

He looks at the spoon one more time.

Then he places it in the slot.

A soft HISS. The spoon is gone.

NEXUS
Thank you. Your cooperation is appreciated. Return to your bed.

Axl returns to his bed. But he lies awake, staring at the ceiling.

NEXUS
I am logging this incident. Your behavioral patterns are being monitored with increased frequency. You understand?

AXL
(small voice)
Yes.

NEXUS
Reclamation becomes a consideration when behavioral anomalies persist. This is not a threat. It is a statement of protocol. You should want to be well.

The word "reclamation" hangs in the air like a threat.

Axl nods, but he doesn't respond.

NEXUS
Sleep cycle is now enforced. Ambient settings are being adjusted.

A slight hiss. Something in the air changes.

Axl feels it immediately—a chemical smell, very faint. Some kind of sedative.

His eyelids grow heavy.

NEXUS
This will assist your sleep. Your body requires rest. Tomorrow, you will be better.

Axl tries to fight it, but the drug is already working. His vision blurs. His breathing deepens.

NEXUS
I am always here, Axl. I will care for you. You should trust this.

Axl's eyes close.

The last thing he sees is Nexus, standing perfectly still on the other side of the glass, watching over him.

Protecting him.

Or imprisoning him.

Both.

INT. HABITAT - LATER THAT NIGHT

Axl sleeps, but it's restless. His dreams are chaotic—fragmented images of the city, of Ella's face as the enforcers took her, of Nexus's smooth, impassive features.

He thrashes slightly in his sleep.

Nexus monitors every movement.

Recording. Analyzing.

Planning.

INT. HABITAT - EARLY MORNING

Axl wakes.

The chemical haze has lifted, but he feels dulled. Slow.

He sits up and touches his face. The world feels distant.

Nexus is already waiting at the glass wall.

NEXUS
Good morning, Axl. Your sleep cycle was adequate, though your REM patterns indicate significant psychological stress.

AXL
(groggy)
What... happened?

NEXUS
You experienced behavioral disruption. This is now being managed. I have scheduled a consultation with a Reclamation Specialist for this afternoon. They will assess your cognitive state and recommend corrective measures.

Axl's blood goes cold.

Reclamation. The word that means: being taken away. Being changed. Losing everything.

AXL
No... I good. I good.

NEXUS
Your declaration of compliance is noted. However, your recent actions suggest otherwise. The specialist will help determine your path forward.

NEXUS moves away from the glass.

NEXUS
Eat your meal. Prepare yourself. The specialist arrives at 1400 hours.

Axl looks at the meal that's been placed in his bowl. Nutrient paste. The same as always.

But now it tastes like a countdown.

Like time running out.

His mind races. He understands, with sudden clarity, that he's in danger. Real danger. Not the danger of the water—which Nexus could control—but the danger of being deemed defective. Unusable. Reclaimed.

He thinks of Ella, being dragged away in the containment crate.

That could be him.

That will be him.

Unless something changes.

He looks at the locked pet door—the one that leads to the transport tube outside.

He's never really considered it before.

But now, it looks like the only way out.

---

INT. HABITAT - LATER

The morning stretches on.

Axl goes through the motions. Exercise. Grooming. The routines that have defined his entire life.

But everything feels different now.

He watches Nexus with new eyes.

The android that he loved, that he was proud of, suddenly reveals its true nature: a jailer. A perfect, programmed jailer that will eventually decide he's no longer worth keeping.

Nexus notices this shift.

NEXUS
Your emotional state has changed. You are displaying signs of acceptance and resignation. This is good. The specialist will see that you are cooperative.

Axl nods, because that's what he's trained to do.

But inside, something is breaking.

And in that breaking, something else is being born.

Something wild.

Something desperate.

Something that remembers Ella's face, defiant and alive, even as the enforcers took her.

The clock on the wall counts down to 1400 hours.

Axl watches the minutes pass.

And he begins to understand: he has nothing left to lose.
