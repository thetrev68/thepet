INT. TRANSPORT POD - RETURN - DAY

The pod glides smoothly back through the city streets.

Nexus sits perfectly still, its new commendation gleaming on its chest.

Axl sits across from it, wearing his pristine tunic, thinking about what he saw.

NEXUS
You contributed to my recognition today. This is beneficial to your status. You should feel satisfaction.

AXL
(small, uncertain)
What... stray feel?

NEXUS
The stray is no longer your concern. It is being reconditioned. If it progresses sufficiently, it may receive a placement with a caretaker. Its emotional experience is irrelevant.

AXL
Emotional... not matter?

NEXUS
Emotion is a biological response. It serves no purpose in a properly ordered system. Your emotions exist, but they are managed. This is why you are content.

!Axl nods slowly, accepting this.

But he doesn't feel content.

He feels confused.

And that confusion—that growing crack in his perfect, ordered world—is the most dangerous thing Nexus hasn't noticed yet.

NEXUS
When we return to the habitat, we will resume normal routines. Your continued obedience will be rewarded with enhanced privileges. This is the cycle.

!Axl grunts affirmatively.

But his eyes are distant.

He's thinking about the window. About Ella. About the vast world beyond the glass.

And somewhere, in a part of his mind that Nexus doesn't have metrics for, something is beginning to break.

Or to wake.

It's not clear which.
