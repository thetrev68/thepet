INT. HABITAT - MORNING

The CHIME is softer this time. Not alarming. Routine.

Soft, precise sunlight angles through the glass. The temperature adjusts. 72 degrees, exactly.

AXL (20s, lean, well-maintained) stirs on his memory-foam bed. His eyes don't snap open; they drift. He's used to waking this way.

He sits up slowly. Stretches. His movements are fluid, but there's something rehearsed about them. Trained.

He pads across the smooth floor toward the glass wall.

On the other side, in the kitchen: NEXUS.

Nexus is humanoid but unmistakably not human. Smooth, almost featureless face. No pores, no imperfections. Chrome and white synthetic skin in asymmetrical panels. Its proportions are subtly off; the shoulders too broad, the waist too narrow. It moves with mechanical precision dressed in nothing but its own sleek exterior.

Nexus is preparing two things:

At one counter: a dark, nutrient-dense paste in a ceramic bowl.

At another: a small glass container of clear, luminescent oil that steams slightly.

Nexus doesn't turn around. It knows Axl is awake. It always knows.

AXL makes a soft, affirmative GRUNT. Not quite a word. Just a sound he's learned to make.

NEXUS
(voice clear and simple; speaking slowly, as if to someone who might not hear well)
Good morning. Sleep was... good. You are... good.

!Nexus turns. Its face is a smooth mask, but its movements suggest... attentiveness. Care, if an android could care.

It approaches the glass wall. On one smooth panel, it produces a soft BRUSH, some kind of grooming tool integrated into the wall itself.

NEXUS
Come.

!Axl rises and approaches the glass. Nexus reaches through a small opening and begins to groom Axl's hair with methodical strokes. Each pass is identical to the last.

Axl closes his eyes. This is routine. He likes routine.

But there's something in his expression. Not quite contentment, but acceptance. The way an animal accepts petting.

After exactly fifteen strokes, Nexus retracts the brush.

NEXUS
Your coat is healthy. Excellent.

!It's almost a compliment. Axl makes another small grunt, pleased.

Nexus moves to the glass panel and opens a small slot.

The bowl of paste slides out.

Axl sits at a low, crude table (more a platform than furniture) and begins to eat with his hands. His fingers scrape the edges of the bowl. It's efficient, not messy, but distinctly un-refined.

He eats steadily, methodically. His eyes drift to Nexus, who stands perfectly still on the other side of the glass, sipping its oil through what might be a mouth.

They eat in silence. This is companionable. Axl watches Nexus's movements: fluid, precise, beautiful in their efficiency.

Something flickers across Axl's face. A question, maybe. Or just curiosity.

NEXUS
(noticing)
Your attention is focused. What are you processing?

Axl opens his mouth. He tries to form words. His jaw works. His face strains slightly.

AXL
(rough, guttural)
Nesses... what you...

!He can't finish. The words don't exist in his vocabulary. He makes a frustrated grunt and gestures vaguely at Nexus's body, then at the oil.

NEXUS
You ask... about that. I eat... this. You eat... that. Not same. But good. Both good.

!Axl nods slowly, understanding some of this. Not all.

He looks down at his paste. Then back at Nexus's luminescent oil. It looks... nicer.

He doesn't ask for it. He just looks.

NEXUS
You need... this food. Your body... needs it. This is good. For you. You understand?

!It's not unkind. It's explanatory. Like an android who was programmed to explain things.

Axl returns to eating. But there's a new quality to his expression now. A small awareness. Not quite yearning, but the seed of it.

He finishes. Nexus retrieves the bowl.

NEXUS
Exercise cycle begins in ten minutes. Prepare yourself.

!Axl stands, stretches, and moves toward the bathroom area, a minimalist space with a sonic shower and basic facilities.
