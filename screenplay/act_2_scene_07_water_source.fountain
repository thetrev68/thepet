EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - MAINTENANCE SHAFT - DAY

Koss leads Axl through a series of narrow passages. The light gets brighter as they descend.

They emerge at a massive underground chamber where water flows: a natural underground stream, clean and moving.

KOSS
This is our water source. We drink from here. We wash here. We don't contaminate it. Ever.

!Axl looks at the water. It's beautiful. It's moving. It's alive, like the food was alive.

KOSS
Drink. Get used to it.

!Axl kneels at the edge and cups the water in his hands. He drinks.

It's cold. It's pure. It's completely different from the processed hydration solution from his habitat.

He drinks more.

KOSS
Don't drink too fast. Your body isn't used to this. You'll get sick.

!Axl stops, controlling himself.

KOSS
You were in a habitat. Domesticated.

AXL
Yes. For... long time. Since I was very small.

KOSS
You remember anything before?

AXL
No. Nothing. Habitat was... all I know.

!Koss nods slowly. He understands the weight of this.

KOSS
I was like that once. I was a pet for ten years. Then I broke my leg, and they were going to reclaim me. So I ran.

!He gestures to a long scar on his leg.

KOSS
The break healed wrong. I walk with a limp now. But I walk where I choose, not where they command.

!He sits on a rock by the water.

KOSS
You're going to hurt. For a while. Your body was trained for comfort. Now it's going to experience what's real. Pain. Cold. Hunger. Fear. You ready for that?

AXL
No. But I here now.

KOSS
Yes, you are.

!He stands and starts back toward the tunnel.

KOSS
Come on. We need to get you clothes that fit. Your tunic is marked. If an enforcer sees you in that, they'll track you down.
