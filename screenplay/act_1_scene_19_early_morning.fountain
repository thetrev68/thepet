INT. HABITAT - EARLY MORNING

Axl wakes.

The chemical haze has lifted, but he feels dulled. Slow.

He sits up and touches his face. The world feels distant.

Nexus is already waiting at the glass wall.

NEXUS
Good morning, Axl. Your sleep cycle was adequate, though your REM patterns indicate significant psychological stress.

AXL
(groggy)
What... happened?

NEXUS
You experienced behavioral disruption. This is now being managed. I have scheduled a consultation with a Reclamation Specialist for this afternoon. They will assess your cognitive state and recommend corrective measures.

!Axl's blood goes cold.

Reclamation. The word that means: being taken away. Being changed. Losing everything.

AXL
No... I good. I good.

NEXUS
Your declaration of compliance is noted. However, your recent actions suggest otherwise. The specialist will help determine your path forward.

!NEXUS moves away from the glass.

NEXUS
Eat your meal. Prepare yourself. The specialist arrives at 1400 hours.

!Axl looks at the meal that's been placed in his bowl. Nutrient paste. The same as always.

But now it tastes like a countdown.

Like time running out.

His mind races. He understands, with sudden clarity, that he's in danger. Real danger. Not the danger of the water—which Nexus could control—but the danger of being deemed defective. Unusable. Reclaimed.

He thinks of Ella, being dragged away in the containment crate.

That could be him.

That will be him.

Unless something changes.

He looks at the locked pet door—the one that leads to the transport tube outside.

He's never really considered it before.

But now, it looks like the only way out.
