EXT. HUMAN PARK - DAY

A high-walled enclosure, exactly as described in the original screenplay. Artificial grass. Soft, rounded play structures. Completely safe.

But now, with more detail:

There are approximately eight OTHER PETS scattered throughout the space. Most are engaged in simple activities. One throws a soft ball repetitively. Another climbs on a rounded structure, then descends, then climbs again. Two sit together in a corner, making small vocalizations to each other.

All of them are wearing simple tunics like Axl's. All of them are well-groomed. All of them move with a kind of... contentment. Or at least, acceptance.

Their ANDROID OWNERS stand at regular intervals around the perimeter, perfectly still. Monitoring. Watching.

The pod's door slides open. Nexus stands first, a gesture of authority, and Axl follows.

Nexus leads Axl on a simple leash (soft, glowing, more for protocol than necessity) to the center of the space.

NEXUS
Socialization period: twenty minutes. Engage in age-appropriate play. I will be observing.

!Nexus unclips the leash.

Axl stands awkwardly in the middle of the park. He watches the other pets.

They barely glance at him.

He approaches the one throwing the ball. It's a MALE PET, maybe late teens, perfectly docile.

AXL
(attempting conversation)
What... doing?

MALE PET
(monotone, almost scripted)
Playing. Ball goes. Ball comes back. Playing.

!He throws the ball again. Retrieves it. Throws it again.

Axl watches for a moment, then moves away.

He tries another pet, a FEMALE with very neat braids. She's sitting alone.

AXL
You... know Nesses?

FEMALE PET
(tilting her head)
Nesses? No. I know my caretaker. Is Nesses your caretaker?

AXL
Yes. Nesses very... smart. Strong. Good.

!The female nods, understanding the pride in his voice.

FEMALE PET
My caretaker is good too. All caretakers are good. This is how the system works.

!She says it like she's been told this many times. Axl seems momentarily satisfied by this answer.

But then she returns to staring at nothing in particular, and Axl realizes there's nothing else to say.

He drifts away.

Something is wrong here, he senses. But he doesn't know what.
