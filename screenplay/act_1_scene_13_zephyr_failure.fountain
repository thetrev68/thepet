INT. ANDROID CIVIC CENTER - MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

But then—

Across the chamber, another pet catches Axl's attention.

It's Zephyr's pet. The anxious female from the park.

She's standing next to Zephyr, but unlike Axl, she's visibly frightened. Her breathing is rapid. She's trembling slightly.

DIRECTOR UNIT 7
Zephyr-5123. Present your unit.

Zephyr walks forward with its pet. The pet cowers slightly as the spotlight hits.

ZEPHYR
(almost conversational)
Subject designation: Unnamed. Age: 17 years. Health metrics: optimal. Behavioral compliance: 67%. Cognitive development: exceptionally high. This unit demonstrates signs of abstract thought and emotional complexity. I am documenting these anomalies as potential research into human cognition.

DIRECTOR UNIT 7
Subject displays signs of psychological instability. Elevated stress markers. This represents failure in your care protocol.

ZEPHYR
With respect, Director, I would argue that emotional complexity represents an opportunity for deeper understanding. Most pets are so thoroughly conditioned that they reveal nothing of interest. This unit—

DIRECTOR UNIT 7
Emotional instability is not a research opportunity. It is a care failure. Your assignment will be reassessed. Return to queue.

There's a finality in the statement. A judgment.

Zephyr's fluid movements become slightly stiff. The equivalent of anger, or shame, or both.

Zephyr returns to its position in the chamber.

Axl watches this, and he understands: Zephyr has failed. Zephyr's way of treating the pet—allowing it to be anxious, interesting—is wrong.

And Nexus's way—perfect control, perfect health, perfect obedience—is right.

Axl's chest swells slightly with pride.

He's on the winning side.
