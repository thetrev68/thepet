EXT. ANDROID CIVIC CENTER - ARRIVAL - DAY

A massive structure. All angles and chrome. Impossibly clean. The architecture is mathematical—no curves, no softness, only precision.

ANDROIDS of various designs move through the space with purpose. Some are caretaker models like Nexus. Some are larger—enforcement, construction. Some are sleeker—administrative, possibly ceremonial.

They move around each other in patterns, never colliding, perfectly choreographed.

The pod door opens and Nexus emerges. Axl follows, hand placed gently on Nexus's back—a gesture they've practiced.

Axl's eyes go WIDE.

He's never been in a space like this. So many androids. So much precision. So much chrome and light.

He feels small.

NEXUS
Remain close. Do not deviate from my path.

!Axl nods, a small grunt of compliance.

They enter the civic center.
