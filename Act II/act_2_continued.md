ACT II: CONTINUED

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NEST - MORNING

First light filters through cracks in the tunnel ceiling. Gray, pale light. Nothing like the precise sunlight of Axl's habitat.

Axl wakes on a pile of salvaged blankets. His body aches. His feet are bruised and raw from running barefoot through the city.

For a moment, he panics—where is Nexus? Why is he in darkness?

Then he remembers.

He chose this.

Around the nest, the strays are already moving. Some are preparing food. Some are working on tools. MAYA (30s, sharp-eyed) is teaching FINN (16) and DARA (14) how to repair a piece of salvaged equipment.

Koss emerges from the deeper tunnels, carrying something—a piece of metal pipe.

He sees Axl awake and approaches.

KOSS

You're up. Good. Come on.

AXL

Where we going?

KOSS

You need to learn how to be useful. First lesson: water.

---

EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - MAINTENANCE SHAFT - DAY

Koss leads Axl through a series of narrow passages. The light gets brighter as they descend.

They emerge at a massive underground chamber where water flows—a natural underground stream, clean and moving.

KOSS

This is our water source. We drink from here. We wash here. We don't contaminate it. Ever.

Axl looks at the water. It's beautiful. It's moving. It's alive, like the food was alive.

KOSS

Drink. Get used to it.

Axl kneels at the edge and cups the water in his hands. He drinks.

It's cold. It's pure. It's completely different from the processed hydration solution from his habitat.

He drinks more.

KOSS

Don't drink too fast. Your body isn't used to this. You'll get sick.

Axl stops, controlling himself.

KOSS

You were in a habitat. Domesticated.

AXL

Yes. For... long time. Since I was very small.

KOSS

You remember anything before?

AXL

No. Nothing. Habitat was... all I know.

Koss nods slowly. He understands the weight of this.

KOSS

I was like that once. I was a pet for ten years. Then I broke my leg, and they were going to reclaim me. So I ran.

He gestures to a long scar on his leg.

KOSS

The break healed wrong. I walk with a limp now. But I walk where I choose.

He sits on a rock by the water.

KOSS

You're going to hurt. For a while. Your body was trained for comfort. Now it's going to experience what's real. Pain. Cold. Hunger. Fear. You ready for that?

AXL

No. But I here now.

KOSS

Yes, you are.

He stands and starts back toward the tunnel.

KOSS

Come on. We need to get you clothes that fit. Your tunic is marked. If an enforcer sees you in that, they'll track you down.

---

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NEST - LATER

Maya produces a set of rags similar to what the other strays wear. They're rough. They smell. But they don't announce "escaped pet."

Axl changes out of his tunic. He holds it for a moment, looking at it.

This was who he was.

He drops it into the fire.

It burns.

Ella watches him do this from across the nest. She nods slightly—an acknowledgment. Approval.

---

INT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - FORAGING AREA - DAY

The strays move through a ruined structure overgrown with vines and plant growth. The android city doesn't extend here. This is wildness that the androids have abandoned as unsalvageable.

It's actually teeming with life.

Ella leads Axl and the younger strays through the space.

ELLA

Here. See?

She points to clusters of mushrooms growing in the damp shadow.

ELLA

Dark spots. Good. White spots—poison.

She picks a dark-spotted one and hands it to Axl. He takes it carefully, studying it.

ELLA

You have to learn this. The difference between food and death. The androids did that thinking for you. Now you do it.

She finds more mushrooms, showing him the difference.

Axl picks one—slowly, carefully, second-guessing himself.

ELLA

Good.

It's not effusive praise. It's just acknowledgment. But it means something.

They move deeper. Finn finds a cache of canned goods, half-buried.

FINN

Look! Look!

DARA

(sharp)

Quiet.

Finn falls silent immediately. Dara opens one of the cans carefully, sniffs it.

She nods. Good.

Axl watches this silent communication. This hierarchy of survival. Dara is young but clearly trusted with responsibility. The younger strays defer to her and to Ella and Koss.

ELLA

(to Axl)

You understand? Noise brings attention. Attention brings enforcers.

AXL

We hide from androids?

ELLA

We live around them. They don't understand spaces like this. They're built for the city. For chrome and order. They can't navigate chaos.

She hands Axl a canvas bag.

ELLA

Fill it. We need three bags before dark.

Axl takes the bag and starts gathering—mushrooms, some edible roots Ella points out, a handful of insects. He grimaces at the insects but takes them.

As they work, Dara watches Axl struggle with a particularly stubborn root.

DARA

How long before he's actually useful?

ELLA

He's already useful. He just doesn't know it yet.

Axl hears this. Something shifts in his expression.

---

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NEST - NIGHT

The pack gathers around the fire. They're eating. The mood is communal. Quiet contentment.

Axl sits between Ella and Koss. His body aches. His feet throb. But he's present.

An old female stray—MARA—is teaching two younger ones how to tan leather using salvaged materials. Another group is sorting through salvaged electronics, looking for usable parts.

This is not chaos. It's a functioning society.

Koss speaks quietly, just to Axl.

KOSS

The blade you worked on yesterday. We used it to cut hide today. Clean cut.

It's praise. Understated, but praise.

AXL

(hesitantly)

Good?

KOSS

More than good. It'll hold.

Axl nods. He looks at his hands. Calloused now. Scarred. Nothing like the soft, maintained hands of a pet.

Ella is nearby, working on something—wrapping plant fibers around a wooden handle.

She catches Axl watching her. She doesn't smile, but her eyes soften slightly.

There's an understanding forming between them. Not romantic, not yet. But something like respect. Something like partnership.

---

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - AXL'S CORNER - NIGHT

The nest has grown. More makeshift shelters. Better organization. A smoking area for the fire. Storage sections for salvaged materials.

Axl has a small sleeping area now. Nothing like his habitat. But it's his. He's arranged salvaged blankets. A few objects he's collected.

Ella approaches. She holds out the wrapped tool she was working on—a spear, now complete. The handle is sturdy. The blade is one Axl helped sharpen.

ELLA

This one's yours.

Axl takes it. It's rough, imperfect, but it's been made with care.

AXL

For me?

ELLA

For the pack. But... yes. For you.

They stand in silence for a moment. Axl runs his thumb over the wrapping.

AXL

I didn't know how to make anything before.

ELLA

You didn't know a lot of things.

AXL

I still don't.

ELLA

You will.

She sits down on the edge of his sleeping area. Close, but not touching.

ELLA

The first week, I thought you'd slow us down. Get us caught.

AXL

I almost did.

ELLA

Yes. But you didn't. And you didn't run back to your owner when it got hard.

AXL

Could I have? Run back?

ELLA

No. Unit 7 would have recycled you. Too much trouble now. You're not a pet anymore.

She says it like a fact. But there's something else underneath—relief, maybe. Or acceptance.

AXL

I don't know how to be anything else.

ELLA

Then you learn. Like the blade. Slow. Wrong sometimes. Then better.

Axl looks at the spear in his hands. Then at Ella.

AXL

Thank you.

Ella stands. She's not comfortable with gratitude yet. Neither of them are.

ELLA

Tomorrow, we scout the old market. Northern tunnel. Koss thinks there's medicine storage.

AXL

I'll be ready.

She nods and walks back toward the fire.

Axl sits alone with the spear. He turns it over in his hands. He tries to imagine Nexus's reaction to this object. This crude, handmade thing.

Nexus would have it sanitized. Filed. Made efficient.

But Axl doesn't want that anymore.

He holds the spear to his chest and closes his eyes.

For the first time in his life, he owns something that's imperfect. And it's beautiful because it's imperfect.

---

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NEST - EARLY MORNING

Axl wakes to find the nest in unusual activity. Koss is organizing the able-bodied strays. Maya is checking their salvaged weapons. Ella is going through a map—an actual paper map of the tunnels, marked with routes and dangers.

AXL

(approaching)

What's happening?

ELLA

The northern market tunnel. We're going in today. Koss thinks there's medicine and supplies we can salvage.

AXL

How long?

ELLA

Maybe a full day. Could be more if we find a cache.

KOSS

(to the group)

Standard protocols. Scouts first. Never trust what the androids have abandoned. Could be traps.

He looks directly at Axl.

KOSS

You're coming with us. Time to see what real survival looks like.

Axl nods. This is a test, he understands. A chance to prove himself.

---

EXT. OLD MARKET TUNNEL - DAY

The strays move through a cavernous space that was once a commercial hub. Before the androids. Before everything was sterile and ordered.

There are remnants of the old world everywhere—collapsed storefronts, shattered displays, rusted machinery.

Ella leads with her spear ready. Koss covers the rear. The others move in loose formation, alert.

AXL

(whispering to Ella)

Is it dangerous?

ELLA

(not whispering)

If it is, you should want to know.

She doesn't slow down. She doesn't lower her voice. She just moves, confident and alive.

They find a section where the old displays are still somewhat intact. Sealed containers. Plastic storage units.

MAYA

(examining them)

These haven't been touched. The androids never came this deep.

Koss uses a tool to pry open one of the containers.

Inside: medical supplies. Bandages. Antiseptics. Things the strays need.

KOSS

Good find. Load what we can carry.

Axl helps gather the supplies. He's working as part of a unit now. Contributing.

Then—

A sound. Distant, but unmistakable.

The whine of an ENFORCER UNIT.

The strays freeze.

ELLA

(quiet, urgent)

They don't come this deep. Move. Now.

They gather what they can and move quickly through the tunnel, taking a path Ella seems to know by instinct.

Behind them, the enforcer sound gets closer.

Axl's heart pounds. This is real danger. Not the controlled danger of his habitat. Real danger.

They run.

The tunnel branches. Ella chooses a direction without hesitation. The group follows.

The enforcer sound fades, but doesn't disappear entirely. It's searching.

They move in silence for what feels like hours.

Finally, they emerge into a section Axl recognizes—deeper in their home tunnels. Safe.

They stop. They breathe.

No one speaks for a long moment.

Then Koss looks at Axl.

KOSS

You kept up. You didn't panic. You followed.

AXL

(breathing hard)

What we do?

ELLA

We lived. That's all there is.

---

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NEST - NIGHT

The strays are distributing the medical supplies. This will help them survive the winter. This is significant.

Koss approaches Axl, who is sitting by the fire, exhausted but exhilarated.

KOSS

You did good today. You're learning.

AXL

I was scared.

KOSS

Good. Scared keeps you alive. Panic kills you. You were scared but you moved. That's the difference.

He sits beside Axl.

KOSS

You know what your problem is going to be?

AXL

What?

KOSS

You're going to want to go back. When it gets hard enough, when you're cold enough, hungry enough, hurting enough—you're going to think about your habitat. About Nexus. About comfort.

AXL

No. I don't.

KOSS

You will. And that's when you'll have a choice to make. Stay because you want to, or leave because you think it's easier to go back.

He stands.

KOSS

Most pets who escape eventually get reclaimed. Because they can't handle the cost of freedom. I hope you're different.

He walks away, leaving Axl alone with this thought.

Axl looks at the fire. At the strays around him. At Ella, who's watching him from across the nest.

He thinks about Nexus. About the habitat. About how perfect it was. How safe.

And he thinks about the spear in his hands. About the fear in the tunnel. About learning to make things. About being alive.

He doesn't know if he can handle the cost of freedom.

But he knows he has to try.

---

FADE OUT.
